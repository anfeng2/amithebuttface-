"My 11 year old son, James, plays football. We have a teammate in the neighborhood and I bring him to practice one of the days because his family needs the help. 

John is a little too much. He constantly talks bad about other kids on the team in my car. “Nick can’t catch” or “jerry sucks.” We have told him time and time again we don’t want to hear it. James can’t stand the badmouthing because he considers the majority of the team good friends of his. John does things like steal my son’s drink and take a sip out of it, causing my son not to want to drink from the container anymore. I have to lock my windows because John once opened it up and yelled at someone walking down the road “you’re a monkey.” Oh and when he comes over for his ride he purposely rings the doorbell nonstop until someone answers it, causing the dogs to go crazy. 

We have gotten to the point where we just leave for practice when John gets here, even if he’s early because he’s disrespectful inside our home too. The day that I take John to practice is now being converted into a team bonding, pizza party and celebrate their successes from the last game day. It’s not mandatory. The coach does this every season once games start and my son loves to go because they just eat pizza and run around. 

This week was the last straw as John was disrespectful to me when getting out of the car when we dropped him off and ignored me when I said bye and then gave James the finger.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-20T02:44:11.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 11 year old son, James, plays football.

"My(24M) Ex(24F) and were dating for four years and recently we broke things off permanently. you see four times for the last 2 years my ex would always block me for a minor issue and say she is dumping me without giving me a chance to speak only to come back 2 weeks later regretting her decision and claiming she missed me.

about 6 weeks ago my Ex blocked me all because I tried to make her happy because she was depressed and wont tell me why but my efforts were qucikly undermined she said I was too childish for her and poof blocked me on everything, 2 weeks passed and I thought it was actually the end of my relationship with her I wanted to go visit her but I know that would cause a bigger Issue so i just accepted things and moved on until I got a random text from one of her friends informing me that my ex found someone else. at first I thought the text was just to add salt to injury but they showed me pictures of my ex going on a date with her rich friend, I made a joke how the relationship won't last because my ex thinks relantionships are one way streets, she wants to stay pure until marriage and expects men to just give her what she wants, the friend laughed and told me the rich friend cheated on her already multiple times and warned me my ex would come back to me crying when he ""spills the beans"".

and wouldnt you know it my ex suddenly unblocked me acting like nothing happend she told me it was my fault she blocked me and I should be the one to fix our relationship, I showed her the pictures of her and her now former lover and she tries to explain our relationship was on hold at that point so she did nothing wrong, and knowing my dumbass I almost believed her but at that point i told myself she is not worth it and dumped her, she cried and said I am a monster for leaving her alone, I told her she has many friends while the only one I had betrayed me.

"So my neighbor has a 3yr old boy that plays outside every chance he has. Almost every time I am outside he is out there. That's not my problem tho idrc that he's outside he's a kid. The problem is he's always out there by himself and anytime he's outside he throws rocks at my window, then at my car. Anytime my brother is outside he throws stuff at my brother. He runs out in the street and plays in the street has no regard for any cars coming. One time I was trying to get into my driveway and he ran right out in front of me. I had to slam my brakes hard to avoid hitting him.  My brother had to carry him back to his house bc he would not get out of the driveway. We have talked to his mom multiple times and she always has the ""oh he's just a kid"" response. There was another time where my brother saw him running towards the main road (which is always super busy especially during rush hour) and screamed for me to get him. Thankfully I got him bfor he got hit and brought him back home told his mom what happened and she thanked me for saving him. 

Not only is he annoying but I also really fear for his safety. I really feel one day he's going to get hurt as we live near a main road which is always very busy. I just would not be able to live with myself if I just sat and watched a little kid get hit by a car or if I accidentally hit them myself. I seriously worry about this kid. I wonder all the time why his mom never watches him. I feel like I should do something.

"This is a PAST story that I think fits here. I'm not with this person anymore and it's been years since this happened

At the time, I (19F) and my Boyfriend (21M) were living together for 8 months, I will tell this story as if it's current 

Let's call the boyfriend Cole. Cole had a large, mix breed dog (100+ pounds) let's call him Rex. Rex is a VERY good boy, very well trained. You could easily train him to be a service animal or police dog. Always followed commands, never stole food off your plate even if you left the room for 5 minutes, could bring a specific toy if you named it, and lots of other stuff. 

Once Cole and Rex moved in, Cole suddenly stopped keeping up with Rex. Since Rex is a very high energy dog that needs allot of mental stimulation, this showed VERY quickly. Rex suddenly would ransack the garbage and scatter it everywhere, steal food off your fork before you could put it in your mouth, try to bite you if you came within a few feet of him if he was given a treat, attacked my cat by grabbing her in his mouth, thrashing and throwing her, and even jumped up and tried to eat my pet snake out of my hand.

Me and Cole kept arguing about this, I told him it was because he completely abandoned everything to do with Rex, he said it had nothing to do with the training and didn't know why Rex was acting like this. Cole insisted that I wanted Rex put down every time I mentioned bad behavior, but I never even referenced putting him down, even after Rex attacked my cat.

As time went on and Rex got worse, Cole started yelling at Rex constantly, no positive reinforcement for good behavior. He would even hit Rex, grab his collar and yell in Rex's face. I told Cole he needed to stop doing this IMMEDIATELY because I noticed Rex was starting to show signs of fear and anxiety. Cole said this was the ""only way"" and continued.

One day, Rex spread garbage all over the house and Cole was fed up. Cole grabbed the back of Rex's neck, slammed him to the floor, sat on top of him and yelled in his face. Rex growled because he was obviously very scared, and Cole smacked him in the face and kept yelling.

I started yelling at Cole to get off the dog, as soon as he did we started arguing. I told Cole this is abuse and would only make Rex fearful of him and that Rex wouldn't trust him anymore. Cole insisted this was simple discipline, and the only way to get the point across. Since Cole was sitting on the floor next to Rex, I grabbed the back of Coles neck, slammed him to the floor, and yelled ""this is how your dog feels"" in his face. Cole shoved me off.

Cole complained that entire week about how he felt like he couldn't trust me anymore after that, I insisted that it was ""simple discipline to get my point across""

My mom, dad, sister and close friends agree with what I did to Cole since Cole never treated Rex like that again. Cole's mom said I should be in jail for what I did to Cole.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-19T20:26:03.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a PAST story that I think fits here.

"I made a post about this 2 months ago and now 2 different sets of neighbors are involved.

We'll call the girl behind me Suzy and the guy that lives next to her Kevin. The two of them are max 25 years old and live in homes owned by family.

Kevin and Suzy let their dogs go back and forth between their yards. Which is fine, I don't care what they do in their own yards.

Suzy has had holes in her fence that allow the dogs into our yard. I talked with her about it, they were fixed 2 months ago, and then Kevin's dog ripped out a picket which created a new hole. Kevin's dog was in our yard from about 4:00-6:45 with no one watching it. Animal control was closed and at 7 I called non emergency because the dog had been out around 3 hours roaming with no one watching it.

We can't have a fence on our property so there is nothing stopping the dogs from getting into the street or highway and getting stolen or hit. We live a block away from the highway. Kev and Suzy can't seem to grasp the concern or see the danger there.

We are also getting our yard chemically treated starting this week. We don't want their dogs coming over here getting covered in chemicals that could potentially poison them.

I'm also 5 months pregnant and I have had injuries to my ankles that make it difficult to balance when I don't have a belly sticking out throwing me off. I'm 4'11... the dogs aren't big but if they jumped on me with my inability to balance I would fall over and hurt myself and possibly my baby. 

My mindset is that they have no idea what's going on in our lives, they don't know what's happening on our property. They should be taking reasonable steps to make sure their dogs are somewhere that they know is safe. My yard is not a dog playground. Yet I'm the bad person for reporting them to the city. 

This has been a problem for a while, the previous owner of our house pressed charges in 2018. We've lived here since 2020. We've given them 3 years to figure out a solution before I contacted animal control months ago.

Anyway, I called the non emergency line last night and an officer went to Kevin and spoke to him and told Kevin not to come over to our house. Guess who is ringing my doorbell at 8:30, Kevin. 

He gets in my face, raising his voice asking if we have a problem. I calmly explained the situation. He raised his voice until I threatened to call the cops again.

He left, I called the cops anyway because at this point he had trespassed and harassed me.

The cop came back to my house, told me I could have Kevin arrested for trespassing if he comes back and he went back to Kevin and explained that. Then my husband caught Kevin shit talking us to neighbors that aren't even involved.

My skin is breaking out, hair is naturally curly and I've been growing it out of a Brazilian blowout so it looks awful, and I have had eyebags for as long as I can remember no matter how much sleep I get. I'm frequently told I look tired.
Today my professor went on a rant about how we need to put effort into our appearance when coming to class. She said we shouldn't have messy hair and look like we rolled out of bed, because it shows we have low self-esteem and reflects on us poorly. I was sitting at the front and there's only 30 of us. It felt very targeted at me. After class I sobbed because I've been so embarrassed of my looks I wanted to skip class before, this just made it worse. Maybe it wasn't directed at me but I decided to speak to her about it and she got upset. I tried to be respectful but I understand that I still may have overreacted. I didn’t try to guilt trip her either.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-18T19:01:01.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My skin is breaking out, hair is naturally curly and I&amp;#39;ve been growing it out of a Brazilian blowout so it looks awful, and I have had eyebags for as long as I can remember no matter how much sleep I get.

I was sitting at the front and there&amp;#39;s only 30 of us. It felt very targeted at me. After class I sobbed because I&amp;#39;ve been so embarrassed of my looks I wanted to skip class before, this just made it worse. Maybe it wasn&amp;#39;t directed at me but I decided to speak to her about it and she got upset. I tried to be respectful but I understand that I still may have overreacted. I didn’t try to guilt trip her either.&lt;/p&gt;

Repost from AITA because they have too many rules 🥲

I (F20) am in a relationship with my boyfriend (M20). Recently we haven’t been in a good place and we have been fighting quite a bit. I live abroad for school and long distance makes for quite a bit of miss understandings between the two of us. 

Now onto the actual issue, while my boyfriend was here visiting me I found out has has been “venting” to his girl bestie (F22) about literally our entire relationship. He has literally been updating her on what I was saying in real time. Don’t get me wrong, it’s perfectly fine to went to your friends about issues in your life. However, in these messages it became apparent that they had been making fun of me. For example during a fight I had quickly asked him if he wanted bread while he was here as I was in the grocery store. They both apparently found this very entertaining, however that was one of the more mild things in these messages. 

I was upset and said that I wanted to see these messages. He let me see them and I discovered hundreds of messages about me. He has told her intimate details about  us both, including what both him and I. (she has also told him about herself) He’s told her about my eating disorder that I’ve only had the currage to tell him about outside of my family. And the cherrie on top was that he said that I was such a horrible girlfriend that he should date his classmate (F20-something). Oh and he also called me a bitch.

Now she says that it infringes on HER integrity that I read those messages. Which had me confused, so it’s okay to tell her everything, literally everything about me without my knowledge or consent but her egging him on and saying that I am a bitch and asking for more private information about me from my boyfriend, that’s apparently completely fine.

So Reddit, am I the asshole? 

Info: 

Everything I read was the parts he showed me. I did not read any personal information about her. I had my bf full permission for this and he was next to me the entire time.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-18T23:09:54.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repost from AITA because they have too many rules 🥲&lt;/p&gt;

"Hi all, I’ve had a lot of people say it was a good idea but I had recently read a lot of stories about people trying to reconcile being judged as assholes or stalkers, and I want to make sure I am not one of these people.

I (18m) had a breakup with my ex (19f). We had a good relationship but she had family issues. I had been helping her out long before we started dating. I stepped in with her permission and got authorities involved (December 2022, we were both 17). It backfired, her parents found out who I was and then they harassed her. She was telling me she was feeling faint and having trouble breathing. I was liable for anything bad that happened so I informed the authorities and the cops showed up at her place. Her trust in me died that day.

We did try to fix things, but it took a nosedive in June last year. I had been going through a lot and my mental state collapsed (hers was already pretty bad understandably). She got upset that I wasn’t doing anything about it (my state is notorious for bad quality of care and bad accessibility to care). It had been going on for some time and I even grew insecure and paranoid because everyone said she was gonna try and cheat on me.

It got worse when college started for both of us. She was good in high school but was not doing well in college, while for me it was the opposite. She became a workaholic.

In October she admitted to me that she was 1. enabling my paranoia and depression for her own gain, 2. Toying with me for her own entertainment, 3. Lying, and then I asked why and then she toyed with me again saying “how do you know I actually did these things?” Kept going and going until a friend of ours confirmed what she had said.

In November we promised to fix things, even if we were separated for any reason. I saw her in December (it was long distance). A week after I left, she dumped me, claiming that I was just too unstable for her (gee, I wonder why). I told her I was gonna leave her be while I worked on myself and she said she’d wait. Thankfully I was in a different state with better care and immediately started seeing a shrink (I genuinely want to fix myself for myself only, I’ve been depressed for several years). 

My plan is to work on myself, return to her, apologize, regain trust, and go from there. All of my friends are for it, the only people against it being a friend of mine (a former narcissist and said my ex is a sociopath), an ex of my ex (he said it was a terrible idea and told me how she absolutely fucked him up), and my mother (who is jealous because I was the only person who gave her attention until my gf showed up, and thinks I’m stalking). If it doesn’t work, fine. If she snaps at me, I’m out. If she gets bored because I can’t be toyed further, I’m out.

I’m actually on a completely different account on the site where we usually communicate and haven’t touched my main one in ages. 

So, AITB for trying to reconcile after self improvement?

"My ex bf (m19) and l (f18) dated for around 7 months. It was the first serious relationship I was ever in. I loved him, and gave up a lot of my time to be with him and help him through his struggles. However, there were plenty of red flags along the way that I ignored.
His apartment was never clean. You couldn’t take a step into the doorway without tripping on a pile of laundry or a bag of empty cans. You couldn’t even see the carpet in his room. He cleaned his room twice during our relationship; once when I helped him, and the other when he moved.
He had a plethora of personal hygiene issues. His hair was constantly greasy, he wore the same/dirty clothes for days in a row, and he didn’t brush his teeth as often as he should have. (I pushed all of this aside because I understood mental health can take a toll on cleanliness.)
He got a night shift job halfway across town despite the fact that he couldn’t drive. Me and a mutual friend, let’s call her Sarah, ended up being the ones to drive him most of the time even though we worked mornings.
And one of the biggest issues, he came out as polyamorous halfway through the relationship and admitted to having a crush on someone else. I didn’t have a big issue with this because he respected my boundaries and didn’t pursue anything, but it left me feeling empty nonetheless.
The real problem started when he began “fake flirting” with Sarah. He had introduced me and Sarah, and me and her became best friends very quickly. In turn we hung out a lot as a trio. He would make “jokes and comments” towards us about us being a throuple that I could tell made her visibly uncomfortable. One of the most uncomfortable I felt was when he “jokingly” claimed that he had a dream that we had a threesome.
A month later we decided to go on a break, but remain friends. I was not very well mentally at this point, so when he told me he was back on dating websites a few days later, I pushed it aside. However, he then informed me a week and a half after our break that he had asked Sarah out, and been rejected. 
I wasn’t overly shocked as I suspected he’d had a crush on her for a while, but I was still hurt. I decided to be supportive because I didn’t know how else to react.
After talking to Sarah, I found out that he had messaged her multiple times on Snapchat about the possibility of mainly being intimate. I felt betrayed and angry, and responded to my emotions by sending voice notes over text, yelling at him.
He responded with confusion, and didn’t seem to understand why I was angry. I blocked him over Snapchat, and we didn’t talk for days afterward. He sent me a message a few days later over Instagram, in which he claimed I was the one who had been manipulative and toxic throughout our relationship. 
I was appalled at first, but upon considering his words I began to experience a lot of guilt. I felt bad for yelling at him and letting my emotions get the best of me without explaining why I was angry in the first place.
I apologized, but I still feel guilty for not handling the situation better.

"My little brother (16M I’ll call him jack) had his birthday party recently. He had his friends over and he had fun.

 The problem is a few days before jack asked me (17NB) to “not be weird” during the party. I had asked what he meant by that and he said “just don’t act like you normally do” I got upset at this and went to my room. 

When jacks actual birthday came around he went out with his friends to get food after school and when jack came back with my mom i sat down with them. My mom was about to leave when jack told me to go to my room. I thought he was joking so I laughed and he just looked at me. I asked if he was serious and he said yes. I looked at my mom for help but she said nothing. I then looked at jacks friends and they were all just staring at me. I got up quietly and left. I cried in my room and then fell asleep. 

Yesterday I talked to jack about the whole thing. I asked why he didn’t want me to act the way I normally do and why he asked me to go to my room. I explained that I felt left out and felt like he doesn’t want anything to do with me. Jack responded saying “it’s because you’re loud and sometimes annoying and I don’t want my friends to hear that” I told him that he was being a jerk and went to my room.

 My mom later scolded me over text for talking to jack about it and that I should have just let him have his day. 

I’ve got mixed feelings on this. On one hand I’m angry that jack said that and that my mom sided with him and on the other I feel like I might have deserved it. After telling some of my friends about it they agreed that my brother was being a jerk but I need other peoples opinions on this. 

AITA

Edit: after reading y’all’s comments I’ve apologized to my brother. I realize it was kinda stupid to feel left out on his day. He accepted my apology and we’re on better terms than we were.

"(Ok the title is from the wrong perspective, but I didn’t know how to make it work with AITBA — to clarify, I AM the drunk friend here)

I went on a girls night out with friends I’ve known for about 2 years after a fancy dinner. I drank too much and threw up at the first bar we went to (not a normal occurrence for me at all, I’m emetophobic), so I decided I wanted to go home. My friends helped me call an Uber and I got into it/went home alone. 

After I got home, I threw up a couple more times and my boyfriend took care of me. The next morning, he told me he was upset with my friends for letting me leave alone. He said if he were in their situation, he wouldn’t let someone very intoxicated leave alone, especially a woman (we live in a fairly sketchy area). I argued that I would have felt bad for ruining their night and they did enough by helping me call a ride, waiting with me, and texting after I got home. 

Next month, I’m going to my first music festival (guess which) with the same friends and my boyfriend has expressed multiple times that he is concerned about my safety with them, because he isn’t coming along. We both grew up fairly sheltered while my friends are experienced with festival drugs, so he’s worried that I will endanger my own well-being. I’ve told him that I trust my friends AND I’m a responsible adult who can take care of myself, but he always brings up how they “didn’t take care” of me when I was drunk and throwing up.

I’m curious what the consensus on this kind of situation is — court of public opinion, what’s the girl code for when your friend gets too drunk and needs to go home?

"Am I the buttface for yelling at my younger sister and getting angry at my mom?

I have adhd and autism, I absolutely hate when people touch things that are mine or even hold them. My sister has a habit of conveniently not noticing what things are mine or not. My mom ALWAYS takes her side in almost everything. I’ve known for years that my younger sister is my moms favorite. 

Every time my sister takes one of my things I have a fit. I cry and yell because she ALWAYS DOES THIS AND MOM DOES NOTHING!

Last night I put my sketchbook(we both have one) on top of my booksack, my sister had a friend over. You can probably see where this is going.

My sister gave her friend my sketchbook to use saying it was her own. The friend drew on 9 pages of my sketchbook. I of course yelled at my sister because she ALWAYS does this with my things. I tried to be nice to her friend because it wasn’t her fault. My mom got MAD AT ME for yelling at my sister and being rude to her friend. Called me a selfish asshole when I requested to use my sisters pencil sharpener since I don’t have one. Like 9 pages of a sketchbook is the equivalent to using a pencil sharpener a bit.

So was I the bad guy in this situation?

"I'm best friends with my crush, and at first I was fine with being just friends because I thought I'd be able to get over this crush just like allll my past crushes, but now the more I hang out with them the more I romantically like them, so I feel like I need space to get over them. 

The thing is, I do NOT want to tell them I have feelings for them, and cutting someone off or just being like ""hey, I need space from you,"" without further explanation seems mean/rude, ESPECIALLY with how often they have talked to me about how hurt they've been in the past when past friends have cut them off without explanation. 

Is there a way for me to ask for space WITHOUT giving them reasoning as to why? I know for a FACT they are not anywhere NEAR being attracted to me, so avoiding telling them my feelings is my main goal but I also frankly would prefer to not lie to them. 

This seems like a stupid post, and maybe there's a totally obvious and logical solution to this that I'm simply too blind to see so please don't be TOO harsh 😭💀 

Also, did I pick the right flair? Does romantic work for this? Sorry if I did that wrong.

"My boyfriend has 2 dogs that live with him in his apartment. He lives in an old building and his apartment doesn't have any kind of garden or outside place where his dogs' can stay safely while he is at work.

 He usually works from early in the morning till 7pm so he leaves the dogs alone inside the house for at least 8 to 9 hours daily. Since the dogs spend their entire day inside the apartment they have learned to pee and sometimes poo in all different rooms, the kitchen, the studio, the bathroom, the hallway, even his bedroom sometimes. 

However, that's not the problem, the problem is the fact that he doesn't immediately clean the pee and most times days go by and pee just piles up in corners of the house. He doesn't even use the pads to absorb the pee and then throw them away.And with time, the place smells really bad inside, and I worry for bacteria in the environment. 

I tried to help him by cleaning the pee but after almost a year I was the one doing more of the cleaning even in his own house cuz he would refuse to clean it or he would postpone it, he says he doesn't care about that and that his health is ok and that I am making a huge fuzz about it. I cannot even visit him at his place because it would be very smelly and dirty and I cannot stand it anymore. 

I am hurt by the fact that he doesn't realize that there are better ways to deal with the pee and that it's very important to me to solve it because we wanna move in together at some point and I just won't be able to live in a dirty house or be the only one cleaning... For background, my mom didn't let me go out play before my room was cleaned and organized and I really value cleanliness ... But I never had a pet when growing up cuz my mom didn't like how dirty animals can be so idk if this is ok or not. 

Again there's  pee sitting there in at least 2 spots of the apartment at all times and if I don't clean it he won't either and it would just sit there for days....Am I the butt face for getting tired of cleaning the pee everytime and getting angry at him for not being able to clean it himself? 

P.s. When I tell him that I don't like it when he doesn't clean the pee or plan a solution to it, he tells me that I criticize him too hard,that I see him with disgust, and that I don't understand how his work is getting the better of him and he is too exhausted to clean after the dogs every day.

"I am 21(f) and he is 25(m) we met while when we were both seniors in college and have always had arguments about what he wants to do with his life.
He started college a little later because after HS he didn't know what he wanted and decided to go work as a apprentice welder at his step dad's company but after about 2yrs decided he wanted to go to college to study business.

We both graduated in May and after I got a job in my field and started to apply to grad schools. He still didn't know what he wanted and was unemployed for 3 months he was staying in my house and I was paying for everything. I told him if he wasn't going to find a job in his field that's fine but that he needed to do something. He then told me that he was going to join the military (he later ended up not joining) .

Shortly after I became pregnant. When he found out I was pregnant suddenly all we would argue about is how he needs to figure out work. He ended up getting a job working overnight at Walmart and shortly after I started having a lot of complications causing me to be put on bedrest my first trimester and having to quit my job (I had been working less than 6m there and didn't qualify for any leave). He told me not to stress it and just focus on our baby and that he will take care of us for the entire duration of my pregnancy. I was essentially a stay at home girlfriend he took care of all the bills, groceries and made sure I got to and from all doctors appointments ( l didn't have a car). After our son was born, I decided to get a work from home job and continue to look into grad school do online. He continued to work overnight at Walmart and I asked him if that's what himself doing for the rest of his life, he said no, but that he still doesn't know what he wants and that he might go back to welding. A few months went by and it's the same conversation. He's an amazing father, but we often argue about finances in the strain. It causes on our relationship, and in our lives Because I feel like there wouldn't be as much strain if he just found a better job which he can do with his degree or he could go back to welding with his stepfather, but he refuses to do either.

Here's where I might be in the wrong . I understand that with that job, he took care of me during the entirety of my pregnancy, but he is capable of doing so much more as someone with welding experience, and a college degree. I feel like I am busting my a*s, working a job and going to grad school to make more money and give our son a better life but he seems content working at Walmart and it's starting to make me resent him. my family constantly asks me if he plans on just working there his entire life and I tell them no but I don't know what he's doing and it's gotten to the point where they're also constantly asking him what his plan is and causing conflict. we ended up getting into a huge argument over it and I told him that if in a year he is still working at Walmart I will leave him.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-17T05:55:47.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 21(f) and he is 25(m) we met while when we were both seniors in college and have always had arguments about what he wants to do with his life.

"My parents have never been in love. My mother, Brenda, has even openly admitted this to me. Brenda had a kid when she was 19, then had my brother and I with my dad. My sister loved me as a baby but left after due to getting kicked out by Brenda. I got to meet my older sister when I was 9. I try to visit them as much as I can but it's hard since they live a couple of hours away.

I can only recall one time I had ever seen my parents kiss, it was in their wedding photos. I remember hearing them scream at each other when they thought I was asleep and I remember my mom crying a lot.

Brenda had side boyfriends throughout their 20 year long relationship. And one of them ended up sticking.
Jeff. Jeff was someone who was silly on the outside but high key scary in reality.

Brenda moved out of the house in 2020, but had already been dating Jeff for a couple of years. At this point, I thought it was for the better. Then things started turning for the worse.

Brenda would always try to guilt trip me and say that my dad ""abused"" her when I know he didn't. She would blatantly lie, he would even show me proof to defend himself. This is when my opinion on her started changing. She started to spiral when I was 12. I was the one bringing her soup when she was sick. Then she lost her job.

She would come over to my dad's (50/50 custody, we switched every week.) and yell, cry, beg, for more money. Every week it was more money. This put my dad in a really hard spot because he was also having troubles with his job. So, at this point, we have Brenda who was going homeless, my dad who was losing his job, me with undiagnosed adhd, and my brother with undiagnosed severe depression.
Brenda knew the code to our house so she would just let herself in whenever she wanted and would take whatever she wanted because ""technically it's still my house since I paid 60 percent"" In my opinion, you don't live there, it's not yours.

Once I hit 13, everything just went to hell. my brother was sent to a hospital my sister went no contact, I was full time with my dad. Brenda lost her house and had to live with us; she didn't want her mom to know what was happening. She made my home a mess and refused to get a job, she would sleep on the couch and literally do nothing.

She started asking for more money from my dad (new job that paid about half of what he used to make) and would be furious when he said no. One day, for the reason of her EX HUSBAND ""not paying attention to her"" she hit his car with a hammer. Then my dad kicked her out, and took legal action because she wouldn't leave us alone.

I forgot to mention that my entire life she would leave remarks about me being too fat or looking ugly and she made my mental health bad.

She got an expensive lawyer paying for it using MY COLLEGE FUNDS and sued. She would harass me via email, gaslight me, and make me feel unsafe showing up to my school unannounced, so i got a restraining order. Brenda is no longer part of my family.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-16T18:34:52.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents have never been in love.

"I (M) (teen) have divorced parents. This is pretty common amongst society but my current situation requires advice which is the reason lmao. 

So before my parents even got divorced my dad slowly treated my mother like shit over years of time. He didn’t make much money… he had no goals in life… yk what I mean. He sorta became a loser after marriage. So before my parents told they were getting a divorce they had already been divorced just waiting to tell me, therefore I was under the assumption that they were still together. So when my dad told me he was taking a yoga class with some girl I got concerned and told my mom leading to them having to tell me what was going on. And lil me thought it was because my dad was cheating. It was these small thing that would lead to big fights and put me in a bad mood. I’d go to school and lash out at people and eventually had no friends. 

So my parents started a schedule where my dad had me 40% of the time and my mom had custody 60%. My dad tried fighting this percentage many times and each time got granted less and less. He started smoking weed and basically became a deadbeat. We lived in a Shity apartment where the fucking paint on the wall was half ripped off and he put no effort into bettering himself. No job. Even my young self started to notice he was a fucking loser. He would even hit me on occasions and there was nothing I could do since I had no control over the custody. Eventually over time my dad wanted no more involvement with me and straight up moved to a different country. I haven’t seen the guy in over a year not a single phone call nothin. 

Today my mother confirmed my suspicions. My dad had been diagnosed with bipolar back in the court proceedings. He had been forced to get examined by the judge and they found out he had bipolar. (My mom isn’t really allowed to talk about the court stuff) which is why I’m finding this out now . Even if he has bipolar …. AITAH for still never wanting to talk to him again??????

Eventually his bad choices with money (he has always been horrible with money) will make him go broke ——&gt; moves back to my country. ——&gt; stays with aunt —-&gt; and I gotta see him (by law)

"I went through a breakup about 6 months ago. I had items left at his place that I didn’t really care about and didn’t want to contact him. He also left some items at my place including a broken drone that he was letting me use for the camera only.

I waited a month to hear back from him about our relationship or his items but never heard from him (haven’t heard from him since). I decided to try to fix the drone, was successful, and have flown it a few times after taking online training to make sure I am flying it correctly and legally. It’s been really fun! If he were to ever call and ask for it back, I would return it to him, but I do not feel comfortable being the one to reach out to him.

My time during the breakup was really tough because I was also laid off from my job. It was the most depressed I had been in years. I typically don’t like to show much emotion or cry in front of family and friends, so when I would hang out with friends I would typically say a joke along the lines of “I don’t have a boyfriend anymore and he treated me like crap but at least I got a drone out of it. Haha!""

I never really took the joke seriously or thought much of it at the time, but I have had multiple friends bring up the drone randomly at different times as a talking topic. One friend said “hey according to the law, he left it long enough at your place, it’s legally yours”. This was fine to me and was a laugh. But on a different occasion, a different friend went up to me and said “hey, I was thinking about the drone situation and talked about it with my husband. He thinks that your ex might be too depressed to reach out and ask for the drone back so you should reach out and see if he wants it”.

Hearing my friend care more about my ex boyfriend’s feelings vs. my own after losing my job and going through a breakup has had a toll on our friendship regardless of the drone, but at this point, I'm just so sick of people talking about it.

Am I the buttface because I still have the drone?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-17T04:03:35.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went through a breakup about 6 months ago. I had items left at his place that I didn’t really care about and didn’t want to contact him. He also left some items at my place including a broken drone that he was letting me use for the camera only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I waited a month to hear back from him about our relationship or his items but never heard from him (haven’t heard from him since). I decided to try to fix the drone, was successful, and have flown it a few times after taking online training to make sure I am flying it correctly and legally. It’s been really fun! If he were to ever call and ask for it back, I would return it to him, but I do not feel comfortable being the one to reach out to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time during the breakup was really tough because I was also laid off from my job. It was the most depressed I had been in years. I typically don’t like to show much emotion or cry in front of family and friends, so when I would hang out with friends I would typically say a joke along the lines of “I don’t have a boyfriend anymore and he treated me like crap but at least I got a drone out of it. Haha!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really took the joke seriously or thought much of it at the time, but I have had multiple friends bring up the drone randomly at different times as a talking topic. One friend said “hey according to the law, he left it long enough at your place, it’s legally yours”. This was fine to me and was a laugh. But on a different occasion, a different friend went up to me and said “hey, I was thinking about the drone situation and talked about it with my husband.

"I had a depressed basement-dwelling loser of a friend who was venting too often. During the two weeks after we spent an evening together, I ghosted him. I was waiting for january 1st to answer to his ‘happy new year’ message by telling him I want to cut ties, because he’s exhausting, and I’m also afraid he might hurt my reputation. 

He snapped at the ‘reputation’ part and spammed me with questions for hours. I didn’t answer any of his questions, I just told him he was harassing me and blocked him everywhere.

He posted an instagram story where he ranted about this (without naming me). His drama queen reaction made my brother (who was a friend of his) decide to cut ties with him too. My ex-friend said ‘my life fucking sucks, I’m incapable of having any friends’.

A month later we met at someone’s birthday party and he offered me a thing I had told him I wanted when we were still friends. On the thing was a note stating ‘thanks for everything, it was nice while it lasted’. 

I don’t know how he was expecting me to react to this, but days later he liked one of my instagram posts and I told him that I asked him not to contact me again, and I blocked him there too.

Weeks later, a mutual friend sent me a screenshot of a DM conversation he had with my ex-friend. The conversation went like this :

&gt; Mutual friend : wanna go for a drink ?

&gt; ex-friend : sure !

&gt; mutual friend : woop, nvm my boss wants me to work today, sorry.

&gt; ex-friend : yeah rite, you’re going to have a drink with our mutual acquaintance right ? No need to lie to me. Tell him it’s not cool to talk shit behind my back

Days later, another mutual friend of ours masked their instagram story because they launched an open invite to their birthday and they didn’t want my ex-friend to be there, to preserve my mental health. But my ex-friend noticed, and got mad.

I noticed that my ex friend kept on following my sister on instagram and commenting on her posts (she’s a famous influencer) and it creeped me out.

Later, a mutual saudi friend that I used to talk shit on went to our country for a day, and organized a party for the occasion. He asked me if I was ok with my ex-friend being there. I told him I wasn’t : it’s him or me. So the ex-friend got mad and spilled the beans on the fact that I talked shit on the saudi guy.

I sent a letter to my ex-friend asking him to stop. Our mutual friends didn’t forgive him spilling the beans and they cut ties with him in favor of me.

I think he developed a huge grudge because it’s been a year now that he’s been creating a plenty of alt instagram accounts to keep on spying on my instagram story. 

He doesn’t message me nor like any post but I don’t want him to see what I’m up to. I’ve been blocking his accounts one by one and he keeps creating new ones.

"I am a graphic designer for a small company. There used to be two designers but the other guy was fired last week because he made too many mistakes. I was surprised they finally fired him. He's been with the company for...I'm sure it was over 15 years. He was working there when the current owner bought the business. But I will admit, he did suck at the job. It was a long long long time coming. 

Today he emailed me at my work email address and asked that I send him a logo. I'm assuming he is trying to build a portfolio but he didn't say why he needed it. Only thing is, I didn't think he designed that logo. I could be wrong but I would be shocked if that was his work. I thought the customer had it created by a design firm. We usually don't do much creative design, we do more technical work needed to decorated/print items. 

I didn't want to get in trouble so I checked with the boss first. He told me to check with the HR manager. She told me absolutely not. If he needed art for his portfolio that he should contact her or the owner and not to involve me. 

I kinda feel like a tattle tail now. I also never really liked the guy and that probably did influence my decision not to help him out. I'm not sure what the chances are my bosses would find out but I don't want to put my job on the line for him.

"Have  a close friend named Emily, who is currently dating Ethan. We’re all  really close, and we’ve talked about sex with each other before.

I’ve  had in depth conversations about all my best friends sex lives, it’s  pretty normal to share that stuff in close female friendships. Ethan is a  really private/reserved person, though. I heard from Emily that he  finds it difficult to be open with her friends (and his friends,  honestly) but he’s never been that way with me. We’ve always gotten  along really well. Emily was talking about their sex life on the  groupchat. She said she can’t have sex with her boyfriend as much as she  wants. I asked why and she said it’s too big, almost 8 inches, too much  for her to be taking every day. She said the sex is amazing and they  still do it often, but it takes more effort.

Our  groupchat had a lot of fun with this information, and with we all  started making big dick Ethan jokes, which she joined in on. It was just  a bit of fun.

Well, I was over at  her house and we were talking in the living room. We were drinking and  her boyfriend was asleep. It was late and he had work in the morning.

She  joked she can’t even sit down because she’s sore from the dancing and I  said “nah, it’s that eight inches, that Big Dick Ethan.” She laughed  and said “shut up,” which is our normal banter.

A  second later he walked into the living room, looking shocked. We froze  too. There’s a hallway between the bedroom and living room so he could  easily hear us, but we can’t see him coming out of the bedroom.

He  got a drink from the fridge and it was obvious he was upset. He went  back to the bedroom without saying anything to us, not even  acknowledging my presence. My friend said she would go talk to him and  be right back.

Well, she came back  30 minutes later saying when she admitted she told us about their sex  life (and yes his dick size) he broke down crying and is really upset. I  was horrified. I always figured he would take it as a compliment. Men  like being known as having big dicks? I left after that, but she was  crying too because her bf was upset.

I  feel terrible. AITA here? I feel so bad he cried. I should not have  made that joke, should I have?

" 

To keep it short, I was sexually assaulted by my ex-girlfriend back in September 2022. She continued to harass me and hide what she did for the majority of my senior year, leaving me with no friends or people to rely on. She used her influence as the senior representative of our grade to tell people to leave me alone and not talk to me. If they did not do that, she would harass them too.

I kept quiet because we were originally in a secret queer relationship and her parents are really religious (they literally run the local temple). I also stayed docile because I feared speaking out due to the harassment my ex gave me to keep me quiet in the first place.

My friends knew about what happened to me, but brushed it off because they feared my ex's influence. One time I brought up how I might go to the school or police about it, and they told me not to because I ""would ruin my ex's life."" (I did come forward to it with the school and police eventually, but never pressed charges in the end)

They cut me off shortly after that because they feared being harassed due to association with me. I blocked them on everything, but now I've realized how wrong and unfair things were. I now know I am allowed to seek justice too, and ultimately I just want my story to be heard after my ex continues to face no consequences. Sometimes I feel she is even praised and uplifted, it destroys me.

I feel hesitance to come forward because it really has been a long time since I've spoken to them (about 9 months), and I know they were harassed too so they didn't exactly have a great experience either. But I feel so much resentment when I keep feeling overlooked and shunned off.

"There was this guy (m20) I (f22, then f21) was seeing a while back who was really sweet, but we didn't work out. It wasn't just because of this question - I realized fairly quick that I wasn't actually all that attracted to him, I just liked having someone look at me that way, and I didn't want to string him along so we talked about it and broke up - but this is something that has been bothering me ever since.

So, I call him my ex-boyfriend, but that's not quite accurate. He's actually a system. I don't know the specifics, but I know that the trauma wasn't sexual, and they switch pretty frequently. I refer to him singularly here because that's how he preferred me to.

NOTE: I have BPD, and my perception of these situations aren't usually all that accurate, which is why this has been on my mind.

Anyway, he was very flirty and would make a lot of suggestive jokes, which was fine. I recognize now that, although he definitely made me feel Some Kinda Way, it was more because I was getting the attention I wanted, not because I was genuinely attracted to him, which... Isn't a great feeling, but I know that's on me, not him, and I should've stopped and dug through those feelings before acting on them.

We ended up sleeping together on our second formal date, although we'd hung out a good bit before and had also been messing around over video calls. To be honest, I wasn't happy that every other call ended up turning sexual; I felt like what I was trying to say was being ignored and pushed aside. I knew he had a pretty strong mommy kink, which... Maybe I could've been fine with in different context, but I didn't enjoy being called that, especially considering there were littles in the system that saw me as a caretaker, so it always reminded me of that responsibility. I already know I'm not going to have kids; I'd be a terrible mom. I do want to get married someday and be able to provide for someone, but when we were together, I was unemployed while he had a job and was paying for dates, and it honestly hit me really hard.

I talked to him about the mommy thing, but he kept saying it on accident; he apologized most of the time, but after a while I let it slide. It seemed important to him. He's polyamorous, and I knew he had other partners, so at first I was hoping that one of them could fulfill that role for him if they were interested, but none of them were.

The thing that made me draw the line was when we slept together, and at the end, one of the littles switched in and grabbed my chest. It took less than a minute for him to switch back to front, but it still shook me. I know it's not their fault, I should've been prepared for that just in case, but... I don't want them to see me like that. 

We didn't go on any other dates after that. We broke up a couple days later, when I realized what I was actually feeling, and we talked it out.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-16T06:17:00.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was this guy (m20) I (f22, then f21) was seeing a while back who was really sweet, but we didn&amp;#39;t work out. It wasn&amp;#39;t just because of this question - I realized fairly quick that I wasn&amp;#39;t actually all that attracted to him, I just liked having someone look at me that way, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to string him along so we talked about it and broke up - but this is something that has been bothering me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I call him my ex-boyfriend, but that&amp;#39;s not quite accurate. He&amp;#39;s actually a system. I don&amp;#39;t know the specifics, but I know that the trauma wasn&amp;#39;t sexual, and they switch pretty frequently. I refer to him singularly here because that&amp;#39;s how he preferred me to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I have BPD, and my perception of these situations aren&amp;#39;t usually all that accurate, which is why this has been on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he was very flirty and would make a lot of suggestive jokes, which was fine. I recognize now that, although he definitely made me feel Some Kinda Way, it was more because I was getting the attention I wanted, not because I was genuinely attracted to him, which... Isn&amp;#39;t a great feeling, but I know that&amp;#39;s on me, not him, and I should&amp;#39;ve stopped and dug through those feelings before acting on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up sleeping together on our second formal date, although we&amp;#39;d hung out a good bit before and had also been messing around over video calls. To be honest, I wasn&amp;#39;t happy that every other call ended up turning sexual; I felt like what I was trying to say was being ignored and pushed aside. I knew he had a pretty strong mommy kink, which... Maybe I could&amp;#39;ve been fine with in different context, but I didn&amp;#39;t enjoy being called that, especially considering there were littles in the system that saw me as a caretaker, so it always reminded me of that responsibility. I already know I&amp;#39;m not going to have kids; I&amp;#39;d be a terrible mom. I do want to get married someday and be able to provide for someone, but when we were together, I was unemployed while he had a job and was paying for dates, and it honestly hit me really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked to him about the mommy thing, but he kept saying it on accident; he apologized most of the time, but after a while I let it slide. It seemed important to him. He&amp;#39;s polyamorous, and I knew he had other partners, so at first I was hoping that one of them could fulfill that role for him if they were interested, but none of them were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that made me draw the line was when we slept together, and at the end, one of the littles switched in and grabbed my chest. It took less than a minute for him to switch back to front, but it still shook me. I know it&amp;#39;s not their fault, I should&amp;#39;ve been prepared for that just in case, but... I don&amp;#39;t want them to see me like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t go on any other dates after that. We broke up a couple days later, when I realized what I was actually feeling, and we talked it out.&lt;/p&gt;

"**Throwaway account - sorry if it's very messy story. TLDR; in end.**

Basically I (28F) have had an ex boyfriend (27M) of more than 6 years, the break-up happened more than 1,5 years ago, the emotions are gone on both sides. Since we have broken up, we remained friends, and occasionally hooked up, most of which was initiated by him.

This happened in the last few months too, until a week ago or so, he has confessed that he has a new girlfriend - so essentially he has cheated on her with me in the last 4-5 months, despite me stating it as a very clear boundary, that I wouldn't want to hookup with him if he isn't single. I immediately tried to convince him to tell his girlfriend that he has cheated, but he said he will continue lying, both for his own happiness, both for her safety, because he's concerned she would hurt herself.

The girl found out about us being in contact, but not the cheating itself, however she is understandably furious, and is demanding to see our online interactions, in which she would see me trying to convince my ex to be honest and admit to the cheating, while he's like yeah I will keep misleading her.

He's been begging me to delete messages that show him being flirty and me trying to convince him to be honest so he can continue misleading his girlfriend, however I have refused to do so.

He's claiming she would harm herself, and it made me think, **so Reddit, AITB for not agreeing to delete the messages?**

*TLDR; was hooking up with ex on the condition we are both single, turns out he had a gf he cheated on with me, now he's asking me to delete messages and lie so he can mislead his girlfriend and not admit he cheated - he claims it's for her own benefit because she's very unwell mentally.*","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-14T08:54:48.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throwaway account - sorry if it&amp;#39;s very messy story.

"I will need to give some context because I promise I don't mean anything malicious from the title.

My girlfriend is not a small woman. She is just over 5' and weighing 330lbs. She has always been overweight her life due to her parents not actually parenting her and meaning she had to look after herself growing up. When I first met her she was 270lbs, which was 2.5 years ago. After a very rough period of time just 6 months later she got to 330lbs, and has been fluctuating a bit up and down since then. Add this to the fact she has an ED, depression and PCOS. I also gained the same amount of weight in this period of time, but I'm not really obese (5'9 at 200lbs). I then lost about 22lbs since due to my work.

I absolutely love her, and I am attracted to her too, a lot. But I am scared her weight is going to kill her or hinder our future at some point. She's become less active to the point she hasn't left the house in a week, she doesn't exercise, she's always in constant muscle pain, and its starting to affect her hygiene (ie showering is alot of effort, sometimes toilet paper gets stuck). Her clothes keep getting destroyed and she wont go clothes shopping.

She is getting help for her ED, and I dont know much about it cuz Its not my business, but I think she is getting better. We also cut off random takeaways too. But we want kids in the future, and with her PCOS and large weight, that could be hard or dangerous. She also needs to get a job since I'll still be in university another year, but its hard passing the interview at her size (not to mention the racial prejudice), and even if she does, im worried about her overworking herself.

Part of me thinks she deliberately isn't losing weight because she knows my type is chubby women and is scared I'll lose attraction to her despite me telling her thats not true. I have told her before that I worry about her weight too and I have done quite a bit to try help her. She agreed then, but nothing is working so far.

"I (29F) been married to my husband(29M) for 8 years and we have 2 kids.

We are working at the same place, since it offers flexible hours and its next to our kids school.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: 6 years ago my husband got into an addiction to cocaine, I found out after one night after his work shift he sent me a message saying he needed this (substance) ,withdrew all our money, turned off his cellphone and went to a house with other coworkers to party and do a LOT of substance to the point he nearly died, after this I found out about other things, like that this coworker would share cocaine with him and they would do it during work hours.

My husband asked for an opportunity to change and get better, he quit his job, switch to another where he didn't have coworkers, I accepted to help him, for us and our family, It was AWFUL, the symptoms of dry hungover, his mood swings, it was a long exhausting journey.

I always tell my husband I forgave what he put us through but I don't forget and I don't trust him (about substance) 

He´s been clean for 5 1/2 years, we started this job two weeks ago and we realized this guy ( the one he would do cocaine with) is working there, when I saw him all of those bad moments came back to my mind, I felt upset and I communicated that to my husband he told me: ""just get over it, this was 6 years ago, it wont happen again""

Yesterday I told him,  I'm embarrassed to see him at the least, I was the one looking for him that night (since my husband barely made it home) He knows who I am, I asked my husband please to not talked to him, ignore him and just pretend he doesn't know him, the amount of ptsd I get from seeing him is horrible, I told all of this to my husband he said he would not talk to him anymore.

today , ran into them talking about work and stuff, I told my husband I asked you to stay away from him , my husband says I'm overreacting and that I should get over it , that he wont stop talking to him just because I say so, I told him again all the reasoning behind my request but he denied, I told him I want a divorce, I feel this is a breakpoint for me, because I was there for him to get clean all the way through and all I asked was respect, that I don't want that person near him.

"I (M15) has figured out from a younger age that I was attracted to guys. In middle school was when I truly found out that I was attracted to guys and I've never felt differently since. 

My sister (F18) has always disliked the LGBTQ community, even though having a few gay guy friends (probably for the appearance to not seem homophobic), she has always expressed her homophobia to me multiple times in a week, or in a day. A couple of years ago, I had told a friend I was Bisexual (I was still trying to figure out my identity) And that friend has told my sister, and which then she told our parents (Who are also homophobic.) I was luckily able to hide that information from them by telling them I thought being Bi meant Bilingual, and they luckily believed it. Another situation has happened like this before previously as well, at the beginning of the school year. Her ex-boyfriend had somehow found out through some people in my grade (Sorry for bad details I'm trying to get to the main point quickly) that I was gay and decided to text my sister about it, which then made her believe it was true. Though after fighting, I was able to gain her trust back and tell her it was just her ex-boyfriend making rumors and stuff like that to make her mad.  


Alright, fast forward to this evening. I was doing my homework and took a break from it and decided to say hey to my sister, but she just told me to leave her room in a very angry tone. I didn't think much of it so I went to go grab my phone to look on it. (I usually keep my phone charging in a diff room while I do my homework so I don't distract myself.) And I found that I got a text message from my sister. There it was my sister took a screenshot of my Instagram chats with a friend of mine about me saying some random stuff about me being gay and me liking guys, and she sent it to herself and started texting me things like: ""How could you do this to me, I loved you I can't believe your like this, your not invited to my graduation party, don't speak with me until you've changed yourself"" and things like that. The first thing I thought is why would she go through my phone since I don't go through hers, and then the second thing I thought is what should I tell her.

"So last year(2023) I(F18) met a friend, let’s call him Jason(M18) in our last year of school together. I went to a private girls school and Jason went to our brother equivalent to my school. 

At first I saw Jason at our schools combined musical where I happened to grow a small crush on him. I asked my friends who he was and they kept telling me that he was an ick. Eventually at a party, Jason and I were taking photos together and he asked me if I could send them to him, I used this opportunity to get his phone number. 

We ghosted each other for a little before Jason started randomly messaging me. We eventually started hanging out and a few strange things happened. There were a few times where he told me to shut up because I was being too loud(he once said this to me at a party where loud music was playing) or to act decently because I was swearing in public. We live in Australia and I’m a wog so I’m gonna be loud. When this happened, I would go quite bc of how embarrassing it was. 

Eventually it got around to him that I liked him and at a mutual party, he confronted me. I tried to brush it aside by saying that I didn’t like him anymore. After this confrontation, he kept talking to me and showed me these photos of him dressed in those really weird and racist Muslim ‘costumes’ from the 2 dollar store. This really pissed me off, I’m one of those ‘liberal snowflakes’ people like to make fun of online but when he showed me this pic he expected me to laugh but I only called him out for it. 

In our messages, he would send really weird flirtatious things. Like “every barbie needs her Ken” and kept resending me a photo of him and I sitting together, teasing me about it. I slowly lost interest in him, seeing him better as a friend. 

I and Jason hung out at our local library to study. We eventually got out of the library and he asked me to join him to get food. He asked me to walk him back to his car after because he felt lonely. During this walk he asked me about the yes or no vote. This was basically a referendum vote in Australia to allow our First Nations people an advisory body in government. I’m a leftist, so I retorted with voting yes. I was 17 at the time and couldn’t vote whereas he was 18. so I asked him the same question but all he said was “interesting” and ignored it. This threw me off guard, I’m personally a really political person and I’d prefer if my friends shared the same values as me. He knew this and when he didn’t answer I knew he was going to vote no. 

That night we were messaging each other and I called him a misogynist as a joke. He thought I was being serious and sent a full paragraph to explain why and how he wasn’t. This turned me off completely and the next day I blocked him without explaining anything. Everything weird about him kinda built up and honestly from the start I should’ve distanced myself away from him. I’ve felt guilty about it ever since. So, AITB?

I went to a private girls school and Jason went to our brother equivalent to my school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I saw Jason at our schools combined musical where I happened to grow a small crush on him. I asked my friends who he was and they kept telling me that he was an ick. Eventually at a party, Jason and I were taking photos together and he asked me if I could send them to him, I used this opportunity to get his phone number. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ghosted each other for a little before Jason started randomly messaging me. We eventually started hanging out and a few strange things happened. There were a few times where he told me to shut up because I was being too loud(he once said this to me at a party where loud music was playing) or to act decently because I was swearing in public.

For just under a year, I dated a guy named Caspar. There was hurt on both sides following our breakup, but we have remained great friends. Back in January, our friend group had a get together and Caspar brought his cousin, John. I had met him briefly once before, and was happy to possibly bring someone else in to our little group. Jump forward to mid-February and John and Caspar come over to help me unpack some things since I just moved apartments. John and I get along really well, and I realize I may have feelings for him. I tell Caspar the next day, and he gives me his blessing to do as I wish, but over the next week, he begins to raise concerns. There is some animosity between John and Caspar's sister, Eve. I will admit, John can initially come across as abrasive at first, but I have never felt unsafe around him. That being said, I do fully understand why Eve holds some disdain towards him. The next weekend, John, Caspar, and I are hanging out again, and I ask John if he would like to go on a date some time. He says yes. Yesterday, during our date, Caspar is texting John and me, teasingly asking how ""you lovebirds"" are doing and things of the like. John gets upset, Caspar calls John, and in the background, we can hear Eve insisting that Caspar ""just hang up and block both of them. Caspar hangs up and blocks John for a couple of hours, and I can tell John is hurt because of how close the two of them were/are, so I do my best to comfort him while trying to smooth things over with Caspar

This afternoon, Caspar texted me and told me that he was hurt by me pursuing a relationship with John. Our discussion about this is still ongoing, but he has come to realize that he is more hurt by John's past behaviors, specifically concerning Eve, than my interest in him, understandably so. I cussed a girl out in AP Lit to the point she ran out of the room crying for a backhanded comment about my sister and proudly stand by my choice 5 years later. What I took some issue with was Eve telling her dad's side of the family that John and I are dating, and them thinking ill of John and me, seeing it as a slight against Caspar. Caspar has said that their mom's side of the family, the side that John is on and that Eve has limited contact with due to the aforementioned family drama, will likely take it even worse. I am worried that I will be used by their family as fodder against John if things get more serious between us or, worse yet, they will go no contact with him. Breaking things off with John is the last thing I want to do, but I would be devastated if his family wanted less to do with him over this

"This happened a while back but I \[31M\] just started thinking about it again for some reason. I used to use some phone app kind of like Yik Yak (I don’t remember the name) where you could share anonymous posts and photos with people around the country. It had a countrywide feed where everyone’s posts showed up and we could comment and upvote/downvote them.

  
One day a girl on the app posted a photo of herself. She looked nearly identical to a former housemate of mine, a girl a few years younger than me by the name of Heather. I commented, “Heather, is that you?” A minute or two later she responded, “Who TF is Heather?” I responded telling her what I just told you about my former housemate, and she responded with an LOL or a laughing emoji or something like that.

  
A few days later she posted another photo of herself. I commented “Hi Heather” on her photo. I looked back a little while later and suddenly didn’t see her post showing up in my feed.

Me and my girl have been together for a while and we are both obese (300+ pounds) and happy.

She used to work the day shift at her job and everything was fine. 3 months ago, she was sent to the 2nd shift which is bad because we never see each other now except for the weekends.

3 weeks ago she began talking about some guy on the job and things they'd talk about. -- I wasnt really bothered by it but I noticed this became an everyday thing and I jokingly asked her to chill. She stopped but now I noticed shes losing weight. Shes going to the gym more and more and I saw her buying a bunch of perfume last week. She puts it on before she goes to work now... Never on her offdays.

With her phone she'll leave it laying around but if shes right next to me, she flips it down and I don't know if shes texting her friends or this guy from work. Should I ask to look through her phone?

Maybe she just likes smelling good in a professional environment? WIBTB if I confronted her on this?

"I had known my friend Charlie (fake name) since we were in prep. i moved schools when i was 9 and we were reunited again in Year 4. We drifted apart in early high school and didn’t reconnect until year 11.

It’s important to understand that she was like my platonic soulmate; I hadn’t ever met a person that was so caring and interested in my life. i had low self esteem and put a lot of my effort into our friendship. i learned more things about this person than anyone. Likewise i confided in this person about everything. we hung out all the time at her place, movie nights and trips down the street to hang in parks or on the beach. i was there for her through everything. 

where things changed was in our last year of school. we both became drama co-captains. truthfully i wasn’t the greatest co-captain, and was often missing club meetings every week because i got busy with my subjects. i tried my best of course but i wasn’t perfect. i was there most of the time. She’d said that she wanted to do the organising and paperwork while i would be the designated ideas person, and i mentioned how i wanted to share the workload. she insisted she’d be okay. she was often the one who was at the club meetings and organising lots of timesheets, etc. That being said, I tried pulling my weight with our performance night, and writing speeches for presentation nights. i couldn’t always be at meetings but i feel as if i did try and compensate when i could. 

as our drama night rolled around with the club putting on a play, i’d noticed how she stopped speaking to me as much and acting as if everything about the play was her responsibility. when it comes to this drama night i was a big contributor; i chose and edited the script, assigned actors, directed scenes. but she’d taken over main proportion of directing and design, changing everything without asking me my input much at all. that began the months of coldness from her. 

we went from dm’ing every day and facetiming to just nothing. the worst part was she never told me why. i was blocked on everything and resorted to sending emails asking what had gone wrong and how i could fix our friendship, and i found out later she was reading these emails out to her friends and making fun of me. i invited her to my 18th and instead of attending, she texted her friends who came to my party talking about how she hated me… while my party was going. 

i’ve been told from a close friend we’ll call April that she has this pattern with people, getting close to them and then dropping them. the angry part of me wants to say she does this to abuse power over others, as she seems to lack control in her personal life.

recently i texted Charlie because she unblocked me on instagram, saying that she should ‘block me unless she wants to apologise for being a dick’ which i admit was a bit petty, but i let my anger get the best of me. i’m blocked again which is definitely for the best. 

i am fully willing to take full responsibility for my actions and answer any questions. i know i’m at fault for some parts, but i don’t think i’m the only one at fault here. so, aitb?

"We got the option to do a cheap wedding that would still get to be very pretty, with plenty of entertainment for guests. This allows us to invite our entire families without making such a dent in our savings. 

But the venue is about four hours away from where we and most of my family lives, thats far enough away where people would likely want to book a hotel the night before. 

His side has been fine since most of them are coming from all over the country so they would have needed to travel anyways, but my family has been really laying on guilt trips. My dad has been very insistent that he will go but he doesn't understand why we would want them to go that distance, and that he thinks it's unfair to him and the rest of my family.

My grandma just called to let me know she's not coming because she doesn't want to be in a car for 4 hours. I'm regretting not eloping.

My fiancee is really excited about the place and honestly so am I, but I just want to know was choosing this location an BH move? 

TL;DR my wedding venue is 4 hours away, family are not happy, some can not make it, am I being a jerk for having set the venue that far?

"Greetings, been a couple days so figured I should update yall on the situation and thank you for your assistance with the matter.

Breif Summary of previous events: Broke up with my Ex, wanted to remove her from my role playing discord server, server kinda imploded, and I posted here looking for advice.

Update is as follows:

- Ex GF is gone, banned her so 0 risk of reappearance later on.

- Nobody left the server when I finally kicked the ex, even the one who said they ""didn't feel connected to the server"" in the second one. (I was told this by a friend in that server, I have 0 interest in that server going forward)

- I ellected to offer an olive branch to those involved in the situation purely as I wanted to get it behind us and go back to normalcy, they feel they were playing the neutral party, I feel I value the friend group more than pressing the issue.

Be aware: I may have forgiven but I have by no means forgotten, I will be watching them closely going forward.

- I was given an apology from one of the people involved with the incident, weren't a key instigator but did play a role. I care for that particular friend so was willing to forgive them as I do wish to keep them around. Again I will still be watching them but the fact they actually made an effort makes me confident I'm right in keeping them around.

- I received a sort of apology from 1 instigator but more about specific stuff than about the situation, I'm aware this particular friend is baised to the ex and somewhat of a people pleaser, I don't really have it in me to stay mad at them rn, but I am unlikely to vent to them about my problems in near future.

Many told me to ditch the friends who sided against, while I was upset I honestly agreed with them in doing so, but when it came to it I was just too exhausted to kick them out as it would have guaranteed a large breakage within my community and friend group as a whole.

I got what I wanted with the Ex being removed, the others may stay for now, the majority seem to be on my side now or neutral to the situation.

May or may not be the update yall were hoping for, but too many life events has left me rather drained, the community is returning to it's lively self slowly but surely and honestly it's all I really want at the moment.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-09T22:50:50.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings, been a couple days so figured I should update yall on the situation and thank you for your assistance with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breif Summary of previous events: Broke up with my Ex, wanted to remove her from my role playing discord server, server kinda imploded, and I posted here looking for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ex GF is gone, banned her so 0 risk of reappearance later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody left the server when I finally kicked the ex, even the one who said they &amp;quot;didn&amp;#39;t feel connected to the server&amp;quot; in the second one. (I was told this by a friend in that server, I have 0 interest in that server going forward)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ellected to offer an olive branch to those involved in the situation purely as I wanted to get it behind us and go back to normalcy, they feel they were playing the neutral party, I feel I value the friend group more than pressing the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware: I may have forgiven but I have by no means forgotten, I will be watching them closely going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was given an apology from one of the people involved with the incident, weren&amp;#39;t a key instigator but did play a role. I care for that particular friend so was willing to forgive them as I do wish to keep them around. Again I will still be watching them but the fact they actually made an effort makes me confident I&amp;#39;m right in keeping them around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I received a sort of apology from 1 instigator but more about specific stuff than about the situation, I&amp;#39;m aware this particular friend is baised to the ex and somewhat of a people pleaser, I don&amp;#39;t really have it in me to stay mad at them rn, but I am unlikely to vent to them about my problems in near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many told me to ditch the friends who sided against, while I was upset I honestly agreed with them in doing so, but when it came to it I was just too exhausted to kick them out as it would have guaranteed a large breakage within my community and friend group as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

"I (22m) recently met this friend through a mutual, probably back in September of 2023.  The first term we hung out a lot and we talk almost everyday.  Although along the way and especially recently I've gotten very bad vibes from him.

He'll always try to pay when we go out, and I make sure I chip in my fair share but I know he's a generous guy.

Okay, so this story is a bit drama filled and I was kind of stupid/naive and I know that, so I just wanted to go ahead and preface with that.

I (27F) got into the bdsm scene in my area about 2 years ago, when I moved here. I met a guy there who I will call Jerry (41M) who I have been on again off again sleeping with as I explore all of that. He is an experienced dom, and *he told me he was divorced and single*. He had a fairly neutral reputation as he was newer to this city, having moved here recently as well. From my understanding he had moved here after wanting to get away after his divorce and be closer to his kids—he has two grown children a few years younger than me. The age would’ve been a dealbreaker for me if I was looking for a relationship, but we got on well and he was an experienced dom, and I just wanted to explore sexually so it seemed like a good match.

I also do theater in my area. There is a large range of ages involved and I ended up making friends with a gal who I will call Sarah (24F) when we were in a show together. Spoiler alert, she turned out to be Jerry’s daughter. I didn’t even think that that might be a possibility. Sarah is married and took her husband’s last name, so I didn’t even have a last name to connect the dots with.

Well on Father’s Day, Sarah made a post about her dad and her ***stepmom***. I saw the picture and there Jerry was, with his wife (late 30sF - I’ll call her Jane)??? Apparently he divorced Sarah’s mom a few years back after *she* cheated, dated Jane online and moved to this city to be with her. I didn’t know about *any* of this.

I immediately chewed Jerry out and broke off all contact, but I didn’t tell Sarah. I’m very private and I knew if I admitted it I’d have to talk about being into BDSM and how I met Jerry, and the fact that I was sleeping with a 41 year old and how stupid I was to not realize. I sent an anonymous message to Jane but she never responded and I didn’t see anything big happen on social media or anything so I guess she just ignored me?

Well, a couple weeks ago Sarah called me to chew me out. Apparently Jane was going through Jerry’s phone because she suspected something was up, and found all his pictures of me (which I had told him to delete). She went absolutely nuclear, which I don’t blame her for, but she also showed the pictures she found to Sarah and Sarah recognized me. I tried explaining that I messaged Jane, and that I broke things off with Jerry the moment I knew, and that I was just embarrassed and hadn’t wanted to share that intimate part of my life with her, but she didn’t want to hear it. She says that when Jane didn’t respond I should’ve told her, and that I’m irredeemable for allowing Jerry to get away without consequences. I can see her side, but I honestly don’t know what to think.

Tl;dr: My casual sexual partner ended up to be my friend’s dad and was cheating on his wife. I messaged the wife but got ignored, and I left it at that without telling my friend. Eventually everything blew up.

"Recently my daughter (7 yo, in 2nd grade) came home from school and told us ""I think I'm in trouble, Jane (her classmate) said she was going to bring a \[pew-pew\] to school tomorrow and \[injure\] me."" She did say she had told her teacher when it happened which surprised me because it was already after 5pm and I had not heard anything from the school. 

By 8pm I had still heard nothing so I reached out to the principal and the teacher asking what was going on and how they would be handling the situation. Later that evening I got a reply from the principal stating that they were aware of the situation and assured me they were taking it seriously and were confident Jane knew comments like that aren’t okay, but they could not share any disciplinary actions taken against another student.

The next morning, I let my daughter know that the principal had spoken with Jane. I incorrectly assumed that Jane would be suspended for the day and sent my daughter off to school

Less than a week later when the class had a field trip, they put my daughter and Jane in the same car. I had not heard anything else from the school during that week, so I followed up with the principal and teacher about the trip, asking why they would put the girls together after what had just happened, again asking for clarification about the school's policies for an incident like this and also why I had to be the one to reach out to them after hearing about the incident from my daughter.

The principal's reply was that she did not feel my daughter was in danger to return to school, but agreed she should have let me know. She again reiterated that she couldn't share specifics but was confident Jane knows those comments are inappropriate. 

I pushed back again asking to understand what a typical response would be for what had occurred and the vice principal said they “talk to the student about it”. When I asked why a student saying something like this wouldn't be suspended for a day, she said they felt the school was the best place to deal with issues and if they only sent the student home there is no way to know if/how the parents would address it. I asked why they couldn’t do both but have not yet gotten a reply. 

At no point did I ever believe Jane actually had the access or desire to follow through. But we live in the US where this is sadly far too common and I think this specific claim warrants a heightened response to help Jane understand just how inappropriate it is. 

At this age kids say lots of dumb things that are just them being kids, but to another child feel very real. Ensuring that my daughter had a chance to be reassured that school is a safe place and she wasn’t in danger I think is incredibly important and would have been more easily accomplished had Jane been suspended for a day.

"I 18m have an egg intolerance, it's basically the same as lactose intolerance for me. My cousin 23m has a peanut allergy and hates it when people 'fake having an allergy'

I have been aware of my intolerance for years and so has the rest of my family but my cousin is always trying to 'catch me out' for 'pretending to have an allergy' I'm not pretending, I have a few allergies including honey pineapple and kiwi. (I eat kiwi anyway because it's just like eating chilli peppers for me)

If I really want something with a high egg level I'll eat it and deal with the stomach issues. Yesterday my aunt made a cake and I had some, my cousin was sat afterwards with a grin staring at me. He then sung 'faker' like a child I asked what was up and he said he knew there were 2 eggs in the cake and I'm not having a reaction (I was actually having stomach pains) I told him this and explained for the 10000th time that I deal with the pain. He yelled that he can't hide his allergy how can I and I had had enough and called him an annoyed buttface (but ruder) 

The family is now angry because he swears I'm faking even though I have literally been to the drs about it. My brother has been arguing with my aunt all day who wants me to apologise (I'm an orphan, no parents to force me too)

My family is in two camps 'cousin is right' and 'cousin needs to stay out of my busines' and I feel guilty about it AITBF?

"Hey guys,

So, this is a relatively old situation which transpired in mid 2022. However, reflecting back, I’d like everyone’s opinion if I was the buttface and any recommendations. 

When I was 29, I was living in Chicago and one of my FWBs back in the day was a lesbian (bisexual?) who dated a verbally abusive woman. Apparently she was controlling, was late for virtually everything, and just a pain to be around. She wasn’t physically abusive, but struck my FWB’s ego often. Tbh, she sounded like a total bitch. 

My relationship with my FWB with twofold: a.) sex (obviously) and b.) I acted as her anchor and we texted a ton or hung out when possible. She was always fearful her girlfriend would get the gyst something was wrong, so we always chilled at a restaurant in Downtown Chicago or my apartment. 

The point being: if you’re trapped in a verbally abusive relationship and your girlfriend is controlling, is it acceptable to cheat? That’s the thing, cheating is objectively wrong, but idk if my situation meets the criteria.

But I really don't want to go for several reasons. Firstly, my grandma mistreated me because I tried to have a relationship with my dad before knowing about his actions. She also didn't believe I had autism until I found out accidentally. Plus, she thinks I'm lazy and not ""manly"" enough because I freaking shave, also because I look like my dad. When I was 13, I told her I hated her, and she blamed her relapse on smoking habit on me. Despite all this, my mom insists I go because ""it's just one day."" And I said no because this isn’t the first time my mother forced me to be around her, my grandmother even tried guilt tripping me on multiple occasions. My mom said she would be sad if I didn’t go.

I know what I'm about to say might sound disrespectful, but it's been building up, and I need to set boundaries. My mom brings up all the good things my grandma did for us, but I can't just overlook the way she treated me. My mom even said my grandma is trying to relate to me, but I'm being an a hole over something that happened when I was a kid. I offered to pay for a babysitter for when she invites her to watch me while she goes out to sea again but my mom refused. She won't let me get a job until the summer or learn to drive which I’m studying for right now) and she thinks praying will solve everything so she said she will pray for me to make the right choice and she gave me a day to think about it. My sister, my moms friend, and mine think I’m in the right but my mom thinks I’m an A hole but I’m tired of being forced to play happy family and I just want to be left alone. I want nothing to do with my grandmother but my mother can’t understand that and keeps insisting that my grandmother changed.

I made a mini contract stating my reasons and said if she signs this Agreement that means I can in the hotel during the party. She thought it was disrespectful. Even though she said she'd respect my decision, she keeps making snide remarks. The thing is this is just a precaution so she can lie about her agreement like before. So, I made the contract anyway to ensure my boundaries are respected. An important detail about the contract says that if she in anyway shape or form I will cut her off from all information of my life, she keeps on updating my grandmother about my life even when I told her to stop, so cutting off her info means my grandmother is in the dark. Its not legally binding or anything, just her writing that she understands why im not going and staying either inside the hotel or the car while I do the homework/tests Im I’m missing by being absent that day

My sister because she saw how I was treated but says I’m in the I’m pushing it, my mom’s guy friend says I’m in the right and so does my friends. My mom on the other hand thinks I am the AH

"My wife(23) and I (22) have been dating since high school and got married last November. We normally keep to ourselves and our families but the other day that all changed. My wife and her sisters were estranged for most of their life and only reconnected last year so I try my hardest to help them with whatever and do what I can for my new sisters in-law and nephews. 

Unfortunately that all changed a few days ago when they decided to cancel on my wife’s birthday plans. We didn’t care at all since we enjoy each other’s company but her sisters said that we didn’t care about them since we didn’t beg them to come with us after they canceled and blamed me for keeping her away from them. 

I have siblings of my own so I’m aware they have arguments from time to time and I decided I would stay out of it even though I had nothing to do with it. They “made up” but weren’t completely on speaking terms and were slowly coming back to normal. 

That was until my wife made the mistake of buying a new shampoo which caused her to have a severe allergic reaction that had us in the hospital all night. Her family was concerned so she posted that she was fine and not to worry as the doctors had already saved her. 

This caused the sisters to go berserk saying that we were fake and bringing up the birthday situation again while she was still on the hospital bed with doctors checking on us every 5 minutes to make sure she’s not dying because her heart rate kept spiking. The argument continues into the next day where I get involved and tell them that they’re weird for even continuing such a childish argument while she was quite literally on her deathbed until moments ago and that we don’t need them in our lives with their toxicity. 

This caused the sisters to once again get mad saying that they did nothing wrong and that they were sending their husbands to come fight me and shortly after they were banging on our door. If I was still in highschool I would’ve accepted the challenge no hesitation but my wife calmed me down and we decided to just call the police instead. 

After the police sent them away we were told by multiple people from her side of the family that we were dead to them and we had taken it to far by calling the police since have criminal records and are battling for custody of their child.

" I live with my partner and we divide chores 50/50. For the dishes we alternate days for who does them and for cooking we used to cook together. More recently my gf has said she's tired around when it comes to the time we start cooking which mean I'm cooking more often.

It's started getting to me that I'm stressed at work then expected to then go and cook for both of us because my gf wants to go for a nap and then I still have to wash the dishes 50% of the time. For the last week or so my girlfriend has asked me to do the dishes on her night because she's tired so now it ends up me doing the majority of the work.

I sat down to talk with my gf yesterday and told her that I'd like her to start doing the dishes more than 50% of the time since I'm the only one cooking. She said it's not her fault she's tired and I pointed out she only seems to be tired once cooking has started.

She disagreed and said I was being unreasonable and that she does intend to help but I just pointed out if she intended to help she wouldn't go and lay on the sofa or bed when cooking starts. She said I was being unfair and using her tiredness as an excuse to start an argument but I just repeated that either she helps with the cooking or she does the dishes.

One Night, My dad drove in from work, and due to a misunderstanding, he forgot to tell me that he would be taking me to see boy and the Heron that night.

I was pretty mad, since I was exited to be home alone, since I thought it was just my mom going, but I wasn’t even warned that I would be going to the movies.

I agreed to go with them, as I didn’t really feel like I had a choice, since you never really have a choice with parents.

I went to the movie, and it was pretty bad.

The animation was just Ok, the protagonist was really boring, it felt derivative from previous Miyazaki Films, the pacing was horrible with me just wanting the film to end, the whole story with the dad marrying his sister in law and getting her pregnant before she even meets Mahito was so creepy, and there was no explanation for anything that was going on and why anything was happening, which led to it feeling not immersive at all and impossible to care about.

When my dad asked me how it was, I simply said that I wish I had just stayed home. 

My mom was pissed, and said I shouldn’t be negative about a film my dad obviously really liked, and even though he wasn’t outwardly upset about me not liking it, It’s very possible I could have hurt his feelings.

"Throwaway account so that I don't get witch hunted by my family on the internet.

For context, I (30F) recently attended the wedding of my stepfather and stepmother (our family tree is a little whack, don't question it).

SM has been around our family for 10+ years now and we all like her, so the wedding was long overdue. It was a destination wedding which was paid for by the both of them, flight and hotel included, so all I really had to do was pay for my meals/any experiences I wanted to engage in when I got there. I went over after they first announced their engagement to offer to do their wedding invitations as a gift, which they declined because they insisted they were going to have a small wedding. I said that was fine but asked if there was anything else I could do, because I was really excited about my SM finally officially joining the family, and they said they would ""find some way for me to be included.""

I had previously agreed to let my soon to be grandmother do my hair for the wedding, which I was very excited to have happen as I thought we'd have some fun together. She ended up coming to my room with nothing in tow, curled my hair, then immediately left because she wasn't feeling well. I didn't begrudge her that because she apparently hadn't been feeling great the night before so I told her to just go rest up. Come to find out a few hours later that my SM had invited nearly every other woman on the trip to get their hair and makeup done professionally with her the morning of in a group hangout except me.

Then in the actual ceremony, there was absolutely no mention of our families merging from either of them. Nothing about the fact that she would now legally have ties to multiple kids, nothing about sharing his love with us, absolute crickets. It is their wedding though, so it being focused around how they met and their life together makes sense, so I didn't say anything about it. Maybe she thought that since we're all grown adults that she didn't need to, I'm not sure.

Absolutely all of that wouldn't have bothered me in the end if they had actually spent time with me, with any of us for that matter, but they didn't.  No meals together, no outings, no ""way for me to be included."" As we would be waiting for one or the other of my siblings to join the party at large for heading to restaurants/events, my SD and SM would simply leave us behind. One of my siblings even tried to call them out on it in a group text and they didn't even bother responding.

I fully admit that I don't have much of a backbone so I didn't really pipe up about any of this bothering me. I just feel like we were a complete afterthought despite them having paid our entire way to be there, and I don't know if it just makes me sound ungrateful or not. If I'm at fault here I'm perfectly okay with acknowledging that. My feelings are just really hurt right now and it makes it hard to actually talk to them because I'm not good at hiding things.

"My girlfriend has a tendency to be quite negative. Recently thoguh she hasn't been too bad until around 2 weeks ago. She was supposed to go grocery shopping with her mum but her mum had to cancel so my girlfriend spent ages rantin about it and how she hates the fact her plans have changed. 

Then she got asked to do something new at work so she spend ages ranting about how its not somethign she's done previously and wouldn't listen when I suggested to talking to her manager for advice on how to complete the task. 

Her car then had a minor issue and needed taking in to the garage. She needs it for her job but her aunt said she would drive her to and from where she needs to be so work isn't affected. My girlfriend still spent ages complaining about how she can't work now and wouldn't listen when I pointed out she can work since she's getting driven around. She said we can now not do anything on the weekend but I pointed out she's only had her car 4 months and we managed to make plans without it before. 

She just kept complaining saying how this last week has been terrible and nothing is ever going right for her and how things are ruined. I asked if she could not be as negative since it seems that's all she is being recently. She said it's because nothings going right and the week has been terrible. I agreed the week hasn't been great but I pointed out she has solutions to the problems she's got but instead of focusing on them she'd rather sit and complain about how awful everything is for her. 

She said I was being cruel and unfair but I just said it's etting draining for me to listen to constant negativity. She said I was being unsupportive and should be fine listening to her.

&lt;p&gt;Then she got asked to do something new at work so she spend ages ranting about how its not somethign she&amp;#39;s done previously and wouldn&amp;#39;t listen when I suggested to talking to her manager for advice on how to complete the task. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her car then had a minor issue and needed taking in to the garage. She needs it for her job but her aunt said she would drive her to and from where she needs to be so work isn&amp;#39;t affected. My girlfriend still spent ages complaining about how she can&amp;#39;t work now and wouldn&amp;#39;t listen when I pointed out she can work since she&amp;#39;s getting driven around. She said we can now not do anything on the weekend but I pointed out she&amp;#39;s only had her car 4 months and we managed to make plans without it before. &lt;/p&gt;

" 

I have worked in my current job for around 16 months. I have the option of working from home as often as I would like with the exceptions of in person full team meetings etc. My old team were not really social and all hate coming into the office. 

Due to this I only tended to go in around once every 2 months. When I started work another person started at the same time as me and she also only went into the office every few months due to her team.

A couple of months ago we both changed team and were put into the same team. This team is a lot more social. They like going into the office either individually or as a team and enjoy going for lunch and planning social activities. I like this as I like being in the office.

I love working from home but it can feel quite isolating. I now go into the office once or twice a week. Not everyone from the team are there when I go in but whenever people from the team are there we will sit together, grab lunch etc.

My team has 8 people, 5 of these are women and 3 are men. There have been times where I'll go into the office and there's only 1 member of the team there and we'll go to lunch while also still inviting anyone else who is in the office. 

My partner has started having a problem with me going into the office as regularly as I am. This has often been with the person who started at the same time as me but it has also been with other team members.

She said it's weird going for lunch 1 on 1 with another woman but I just pointed out they were my colleagues and it's not like it's ever planned to just be 2 of us in, it just depends on the rest of the team.

My gf has said she thinks if it's only going to be 1 member of the team in the office that I shouldn't go in or at least go to lunch with them. I told her there shouldn't be a problem with me making friends at work but she just said its disrespectful that I'm not listening to her and considering not going to lunch 1 on 1 with another woman. I'm not sure what to do here, does anyone have any advice on how to handle this situation?

"I (23, NB) broke up with my now ex girlfriend (26, F) on Monday. Due to several reasons I don't wish to discuss as it's a painful subject at this point.

Now I run a Role Playing Discord Server, for well over a year at this point. The members are a long term friend group of mine with a few additions here and there.

I invited my ex months back, before we were dating, she became friends with people on there and we ended up dating but have now split.

Yesterday I wanted to remove her, I talked to a friend and they strongly disagreed with it. Saying if my girlfriend had dumped me instead I'd still be expected to keep her in the server, and told me ""we both know she was using you as a therapist"" which was part of the reason I broke up with her, along with other things.

They suggested I talk to ex, I did and she agreed to leave. I told her I'd let her stay till she set up a new server and friended people, as I didn't want to cut her off I just don't want to be around her.

After this she told our friends who told her to stay anyway, and she back tracked.

It went public and I was told to put her in ""quarantine"" (restricting her to only a couple chats) so I could pretend she doesn't exist. I insisted I just want her to leave so I could have space to heal.

I was called stubborn, told I was breaking the community, told I was ""kicking her out of our home"", and when I brought up how I just didn't want my ex in my passion project I was told ""it's not your passion project anymore it's a community""

Context: The server is a Murder Mystery at heart. I run the server, I built the server from scratch for us to play, I wrote up the Scenarios that I run, make Roles for people to pick from, and made countless role-playing chats. I run this entirely alone the majority of the time, hence why I class it as my passion project. This is something important enough to me I want to make it my career, this is a well known fact within the group.

I offered to build a server for the ex, but wasn't enough. While this was going on they made a secret second server anyway despite repeatedly saying ""a second server would just die out""

Now Ex is in their ""quarantine"" and I've seen her state ""I'm infected with Bad Guy disease and [Me] is unvaccinated"" in their not so secret second server.

I am extremely uncomfortable even being around my ex, but it seems that nobody is willing to hear me out. They keep saying they're not taking sides or forcing me to put her mental health above my own, so maybe I'm just over reacting?

Everyone I tell outside the server says they're being unreasonable so idk what to think anymore, I just wanted space while I processed stuff.

TLDR: I wanted to remove my ex from my server and many of my friends on there are refusing to let me, non server friends think they're being unreasonable and I just want space from the ex.

"First off, context would probably be important. My friend (18F), who we will call Nikki, and I (18M) created a group of each of our close friends, which ended up being around 10 people of 4 guys and 6 girls. With this group, we spent basically every day together during our junior year summer

&amp;#x200B;

However, during the school year, I started to feel distant from the group. I originally chalked it up to clubs/school work, and would sometimes be gone for tournaments.

&amp;#x200B;

After 2 months of this, I started to realize that even when I was able to hang out with them, it felt very odd. They would whisper to each other when I was around, they would give a judging remark to anything that I said, and would overall kind of ignore me and these other two girls that were closer to me, who will go by Rachel and Stella (Both 18f).

&amp;#x200B;

5 months later and a year from today, it all came to a head right before our school's winter ball, which I thought we would go to as a group. However, a week before the dance, Nikki texts our group chat accusing of me, Rachel, and Stella of planning a sleepover for the night of the dance without them. I shot this down, because none of us had even discussed anything.

&amp;#x200B;

This brought hours of argument, which ended when they 180'ed the conversation. They began to say that it wasn't about the sleepover, and were just distancing for differing reasons. Most of their complaints were that they didn't really feel like they understood my humor and how it was different, but one stood out. One of the guys, Max (18m), expressed that he was uncomfortable with the bro-mantic/gay jokes, which was a problem because I was bi.

&amp;#x200B;

With everyone telling me all of that, they stopped talking in the group chat. We stopped talking in person. This hurt me. I even cried for the first time in a while. I wasn't sad about them cutting me off, but about how they didn't try to repair the friendship. It took me months and going to college to make new friends, and even more for my trust issues to come back. To this day, I still overthink once in a while and it has made me more closed off than I was before.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to now, I have a new group and in college, with the old group going to the same college. Nikki and another girl in the old group, will be named Sara (18f), have come up to me many times and tried to make conversation, which always end up being small talk. I absolutely hated this, and wished to be basically left alone.

&amp;#x200B;

One day, when Sara texts me asking to catch up. Pent up due to them essentially pretending as if we were still friends, I sent her a angry paragraph to her explaining that I did not want to talk and how I was hurt by what had happened in the past. She passively aggressively texts back that she had never took a part in kicking me out, and that she just wanted to check up on me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now none of them talk to me, which I think it is good. However, I think I may have been too mean and she could also be right in the way that she was never involved.

"Title sounds bad but hear me out lol. I (27F) lived abroad with a cousin, who we’ll call Anne, when I was 22-24 and getting a Master’s. I met a 32 y/o PhD student in the same field of study. We’ll call him Alex. He and I started dating at the beginning of the first school year of my degree and I turned 23 soon after. He was NOT my professor but he did end up co-teaching a course during my second semester because one of my professors was his advisor and they were doing research together. Alex was also the professor’s assistant (basically a TA I think but we probably used a different term for it) for a course or two, but I don’t remember him being responsible for grading papers or anything like that. 

We were together for around 1.5 years and ended things amicably. For me, I never felt like our 9.5 year age difference was a bad thing. He was a great guy, respectful, successful, and had his life together but didn’t try to leverage his age or experience over me. It was a normal, healthy relationship. 

My cousin Anne’s family are very close friends of my husband and his family—that’s how I met my husband actually. Well Anne mentioned to some of her friends that I “was f***ing [my] professor” when we lived together in France. (Tbh I don’t mind her telling them that because it’s half true, it was years ago, and it’s kind of funny when you put it like that.) The problem is that those friends went and told my husband’s sisters because they’re all in the same friend group. My SIL messaged me about it so I told my husband to avoid him finding out from a third party in the future.  

My husband (31M) already knew I dated another student at my university but he didn’t know about the age gap and that he had been teaching some of my classes/was my TA. He feels like I lied to him by omission and says he “sees me differently” knowing I was in a relationship like that where I “happily let an older guy use me”. It offends me that he sees it like that and I don’t think it was a big deal that he didn’t know. I agree though that I wasn’t fully honest about things. I again just didn’t think it was important and didn’t want any judgment because I know how it sounds on paper. We also don’t tend to talk about our previous relationships, so it never came up. 

Am I the buttface here? Is he? Are we both in the wrong somewhat? I know I should apologize but at the same time I don’t feel like I did anything unjustified. Help me understand, please!

"Hey everyone. Yesterday, I posted this thread in AITA before it was removed because it mentioned violence. When I posted this thread yesterday, I was just feeling sad. But now, I'm angry. I can't help but feel angry at everyone and everything, including my little sister. I've copied-and-pasted my post in AITA here:

""I (m30) have an 18-year-old sister named Angela. For the first 10-ish years of her life, Angela was a normal happy girl, and our family was normal. After her 10th birthday, our father turned into a monster towards her. Our mother did not actively hurt my sister, but mom did nothin to keep her safe. I was in the Navy while my little sister was going through hell at home, and I was oblivious to everything. I mean, sometimes I would visit my family, and my sister was no longer the cheerful little girl that I knew, but I just thought it was typical teenage angst.

My sister told me, only relatively recently, why exactly she was so moody and downcast throughout the past several years. I was stunned, and I helped her run away and she lived with our aunt and uncle (who are awesome and they have reigned hell on our parents) until she moved away for college.

My sister and lost her temper at me last month. She regularly has mood swings, and she would alternate between being kind and compassionate towards me, and being so angry. Anyway, last month, she told me that she hates me and that she blames me for not rescuing her earlier. She said the most awful stuff during our argument. And I didn’t argue back at her. What could I say to someone who has been through what she’s been through? She did apologize to me in the evening, and all I could do was apologize to her.

A few days afterwards, Angela visited my wife and I. I sat down with my sister, and I really urged her to go to therapy (I don’t know if her college’s health and wellness center would suffice but she does have access to that) and figure out how to let go of her anger. I motioned with my hand, and I turned my hand into a tight fist and just released it, telling her to let go like that. I regret saying this, because my sister started crying, and she just screamed that she wants to die.

"My mom and dad have always had a weird relationship. They are friendly most of the time but my dad is a very condescending person. There were some disputes between their families when they got married (arranged marriage) almost 20 yrs ago. My dad is still holding on to that and will occasionally make sparky comments about my mom's family. She doesn't like it, but ignores it for the sake of maintaining peace in the house.

I'm 17, and have a lot of entrance exams in the next month, which is  why it is necessary that the environment remains tranquil. My dad probably has undiagnosed bipolar disorder. One day he's happy, and joking around, and the next he turns into a tincan which radiates negative energy. Will only say hurtful things. 

My mom's sister was traveling for some work related stuff and asked if she could stay at our house instead of a hotel. My mom obviously agreed. She asked my dad and he didn't disagree, but immediately resorted to tincan mode. The day before her arrival, he started cursing my mom out of nowhere. He called her a bad and selfish mother And a leech who gives his hard earned money to her family. Neither of it is true. My mom earns her own money and is the best mom in the world. 

He said that the guest would disrupt my studies, eventhough she was just gonna stay for 2 days. My mom gets hurt very easily, and started crying. Earlier in 2023, my paternal grandparents stayed in our house for almost 6-7 months being the most uncooperative lot ever. Their presence had actually affected my studies a lot, also my peace of mind was gone.

All this set me off and I told him to shut his mouth because he wasn't making any sense. At this my dad said that I was brainwashed by my mom's family and they're actually rascals after his money. (Keep in mind, I didn't even get to meet any of them until I was 10 and they're the nicest people ever). To this I said that it was his family that is the asshole and keeps leeching off of him. Your parents and brother are the ones who keep asking you for money. My dad got really angry and left for the office, on the way he crashed the car and is now in the hospital with mediocre injuries. My mom told her sister not to come in the end.

Now everyone is treating me as though, I was the one who caused the accident, even my mom :(.

" One  type of holiday I've wanted to do for years is a cruise. I have been  working in my current job for 2 years and there have been a lot of exams  with work to fully qualify. Next year I will finish my last exams so I  thought it was the perfect time to treat myself to a cruise.

My  girlfriend has always said she'd never go on one. She doesn't like the  idea of being out at sea and just said it's not the type of holiday  she'd enjoy. I started looking at cruises available from the UK for next  year to see what my options are.

I  mentioned this to my girlfriend and she asked why I was thinking about a  cruise. I said because she knows I have always wanted to go on one and  that it would be nice to treat myself for finishing exams. She asked  what about our holiday next year. I said we'd still be able to go on one  but it would either be a bit later/earlier than usual and maybe a night  or two shorter.

I mentioned that  she's welcome to join me on the cruise but she refused. She said it's  not fair that our holiday has to suffer just so I can go away. I pointed  out it's a one off to celebrate my achievement and that it's not going  to be a regular thing. She just said that our holiday shouldn't be any  shorter and that I'm wrong for prioritising the cruise.

"Posting this here as I got my post removed at AITA. I'm not sure how to add both serious and romantic flair if that's possible so kindly consider this as both.  


a few hours ago I got into an argument with my wife.

The conversation went like this:

Wife sleeping on the bed randomly asks me: what are you thankful for today?

Me: for being alive.

Wife: no other things?

Me: for everything. For still having color in my life.

We then go on a back and forth regarding this specific question. What she meant was more deeper and wanted me to expound on it. What she meant was that if I reflected on the day I spent today, what were the things I appreciated happening today to which I replied by telling her that if she needed an answer that she wanted to hear then lead with that question instead or ask directly to which she replied I should have known it was that kind of question.

She's an extrovert. I'm an introvert. We've been married for 8 years and this one regularly grinds her gears. I give truthful and straightforward replies because that is what I genuinely think and she gets annoyed when I do it. I explained to her that we've been married for 8 years already and this is how my brain process things and I do not possess the ability to read minds. Her rebuttal was similar albeit fair, she mentioned that we're married for 8 years already so I should understand how she wants her questions to be answered. She further defends her point by saying when she talks to her friends they normally understand what she is trying to ask for.  


Now she's mad and doesn't want to talk anymore. I feel like when questions like these are thrown at me, it always feels like I'm about to step on a landmine and when fights like these happens they tend to spiral further and I would really like this cycle to stop.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-05T20:17:41.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posting this here as I got my post removed at AITA.

"Im 22 and i live with my dad and his girlfriend. After i finished school i finally got a job that paid enough for me to both pay my own personal bills (like my credit cards, car and pet insurance, and school fees) and start paying bills around the house. Neither forced me to do it either, i just offered to start pitching in. I picked up the phone and internet/tv bill (two separate services) which put me at 320$ a month. Once the “keys” were handed to me, i found that my dad and his gf had crazy interest, late unpaid payments and late fees tacked onto both bills, a combined 400$ for both fees. They were seriously inflating the monthly charge. They had no idea because they only paid over the phone/in person and never online where they could see the charge breakdown.So i paid off all the overdue crap which cut the monthly charge down to a mere 150$ a month. I was pumped. And then i stopped being pumped because i made the mistake of telling my father that i managed to cut down the price and after like an hour of trying to convince him that it was a self inflicted charge, and not that they were being overcharged or that i cut their services, he got annoyed that i “got away” with picking the cheapest bills, even though he suggested i pick those two so i could even dream of putting away some money for savings. I offered to pay a small portion of another bill like the water or electric (bc i definitely cannot afford to foot the whole charge) and reminded him that i pay for all of the “fun” services like Netflix and food/grocery delivery that they enjoy daily.

"I (20f), started going out with a guy ""J"" (21m) a few weeks ago. We met on a dating app.

My parents are very controlling, and me and my sister grew up afraid of telling them things. 

I have struggled with mental health for years now, and I really don't have many friends to go out with. I've been feeling much better lately and it's good for me to go out and have fun. 

I'm too scared now to tell my parents about J, so I always lie when I go out with him. Today I told them I'm staying in college with some classmates to finish a group project, and having dinner with them. But I'm actually having dinner with him.

I always feel guilty when I get home, but I don't know what else I can do.

"I know this is really silly and inconsequential, but I kinda want to know your opinion on this I am 36f, I live alone, but still receive help form my parents occasionally, because I have several disabilities that make living alone hard. I recently found some stickers online I really like and started decorating everything including my water bottles, my reader and even my laptop. I love to decorate and despite my age I still have an attachment to all things sparkly and cute, but usually I keep it contained to areas that are private like my house, especially the fandom stuff. I blame ADHD impulses for the sudden need to re decorate my space, but I just had a need to express myself creatively and I was stuck in a writing slump.

My mother said that it was rather childish and unprofessional and that people might judge me especially in a professional surrounding. I am torn on the one hand I can see where she is coming from, not just the stickers, but also the impulse baying.

"So this is going to be a long read sorry in advance. I 34f and bf 37m have been with my boyfriend for almost 11 years now. Been engaged but he broke the engagement last year. Me thinking he will think things over. I also have a son from my previous marriage 16m my bf and son got along when my son was younger but now a days they not best buds anymore. My bf was brought up in a stricked household so he is trying to implement those rules to my son. I didn't have a issue with this but my main issue was the way he implemented punishments.
The straw that broke the camels back was last night when my bf told me matter of factly he hit my son. I saw red at the moment and said I'll be moving out. I don't have a job nor a place to stay so we basically my son and I will have to move to my mother. She lives in another city so I need to uproot my son and take my chances with no income. I must add my son is special needs so normal punishment for him will be like taking water away from a fish. I have my own way of teaching him write from wrong but bf says I'm to soft. I have noticed my son doesn't respond well with people talking loudly nor if someone is yelling at him he won't do what you want. 
So will I be the a hole if I leave? Uprooting my child and starting new with nothing but the clothes on my back?

This happened a few days ago and one of my (19f) brothers Carson (13m) is still giving me the cold shoulder over it. A week ago, my parents left for a business trip and left me and my brothers home alone. Everyday, our parents would check up on us before we'd go about our day. For most of that week, Carson was sick, so I'd keep track of what medicine he took and what time he took it as well as call his school to report his absence. I'd also go to university a little later to make sure my other brother Felix (9m) went to school.

On Thursday, Carson felt slightly better, so we decided that he'd go to school on Friday. I returned from university a little later (at 6:00PM), and almost immediately, my parents called me to go to the pharmacy near our place to buy some cough syrup in case Carson needed it, so I did. I felt very tired and sleepy afterwards since it was a long day, so I decided to take a nap.

I expected to sleep for only 1-2hrs, but I guess I was very sleepy because I woke up at 1 in the morning. I stepped into the hallway to get myself a drink of water, but then I heard some noises downstairs. I walked to the living room to find Carson watching tv. I probably wouldn't have cared if it weren't for the fact that it was a school night, so I confiscated the remote and told Carson to go to bed. He smiled and walked to his room in the basement.

Then I went to check on Felix, only to find him watching videos on his phone, so I did the same to him. Then I remembered that it would be a garbage day the next morning, so I went outside to take the trash out, when I noticed the basement lights were on. I walked downstairs to find Carson on his phone. Exasperated, I took his phone and the other remotes in the basement (since the room had TVs as well) and told him that if I caught him doing that again, I'd call Mom. He obliged, then I walked upstairs, only to hear Felix running around giggling. Having had enough of their actions, I yelled that I'm telling Mom and did just that.

She was very mad, and asked me to go to their rooms with video camera on so she could scold them. Carson was silently crying, while Felix pretended to sleep, then she told me to clean the kitchen, and then study for a bit before going back to sleep, which I did.

In the morning, Carson was very pissed off with me for calling Mom on him. He didn't want to do anything I told him to because of what I did, including taking his daily medicine. He also refused to help me out with the house chores out of spite, despite the fact that it would be the day that our parents would return.

In the end, even though he mostly got over it, he still is being upset with me, so I have to wonder if I went a little too far with this.

"**Background**

I've considered this friend a close friend. I know I haven't been present for most of their functions and have even stopped inviting me because I decided to focus on my (now) fiancee and our mutuals. This friend finally snapped and, to his credit, has told me that it doesn't feel like I've been a friend to him and if I feel the same way, we can part ways and he has to make peace with that. The wham line in his message was ""you weren't there for me when I needed you. When I called out, you ignored me."" I thought he was being overdramatic.

My brother is also a close friend with him. I asked him about this line and my brother told me some truly horrible things like my friend getting into a car accident, caught COVID, was in therapy for abuse and worsening depression, etc. The rest of my old friend group was there. But my brother gave me the same message- he was there when you were at his lowest. He sacrificed a lot of time with his then-girlfriend to make sure I went out and was ok. And my brother said ""bro, if I'm being honest here, that message he sent you was being *nice*. He has every right to be angry"" My brother says there's more that there's more my friend told and asked him about me. 

**The question at hand**

Yesterday was his birthday but I was away doing my proposal. I sent him a birthday wish and my engagement photos to the group. According to my brother, that's all the group could talk about while my friend just sat silently. He sent a congratulatory message but my brother said he looked annoyed, saw the photos and basically just sat silently for the rest of the night. According to my brother, only he and my friend's best friend know how he's been feeling about me and they said it was tacky for me to do this and pretty much make his birthday a pseudo engagement party for me. I want to talk to him but he left me on read. I offered to make things right but he won't answer me. My brother told me to give him time but I know I haven't been there and I didn't know things were so bad with him. His best friend and my brother told me that I could have waited a day but I was too excited.

tl;dr: Sent my engagement photos as part of my well wishes for his birthday. His friend and my brother told me that I basically hijacked his birthday and I am in the wrong for not waiting a day.

Am I the buttface here?

EDIT:

Fine, you people were right, I was the BF here. My friend's message wasn't angry, it was just sadness. I wish he would scream at me or lash out but it just reiterated how sad it was to feel like he was tossed away after being there for me during my darkest hour. He said that he couldn't handle the resentment from the abandonment anymore and that I was the main reason he got rid of IG because it showed how happy I was without him and without our group. He said that things in his life are not going well and realizing that someone he thought was his close friend kicked him to the curb made it worse. He thanked me for the good memories and said that we will only be communicating at social events with the rest of the group and told me and my brother to not get anybody else in my original group of friends involved because he doesn't want them to feel awkward.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-03T18:39:54.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"So Im the only female(also a black woman) at my job and I feel bad for feeling this way but Im feeling like Im being discriminated against even though it is a bit petty.

Basically my job is featuring me in a post for women's week next week and I had a concern that I didnt want my full name in the post. My supervisor told me I had nothing to worry about and the post was only going to be shared to linkedin and maybe twitter and no other platforms because apparently a ""different person"" manages the other social media posts. I looked at all their platforms and they have the same posts across the line so now Im wondering why a post featuring me is only being shared to one or two platforms..

Im not really concerned about the attention from posts. Im concerned about the actions of the company... Why is it that my white colleagues are shared to all platforms but Im only being featured on linkedin and ""maybe"" twitter?

WIBTB I bring this matter up to my union steward? Is this even a matter I can bring up to him?

So I (19f) am in my first year of university. It was hard to adjust to it at first, but now I've grown accustomed to it. I have this friend we'll call Lucy (19f). Lucy is super nice and cool, however I've lately grown annoyed by her. You see, all she ever talks to me about is her ex-boyfriends. While I'm always open to letting her vent, it's gotten too much and I just wish that we'd talk about anything other than boy drama. She'd even ask me to spy on them for her, which I didn't want to do. Recently, one of her exes also texted me suddenly.

However, I also didn't want to cut her off. She was really nice and caring, and she already lost so many friends that it just feels too cruel to do so. So I decided to text my best friend Mira (19f) about this to ask for advice. She told me that I should tell Lucy about how I feel about this. That I'd like to talk about stuff other than her exes since it was too much for me but I'd also like to be her friend at the end of the day. Mira also told me that it would be a good idea to let Lucy know that one of her exes contacted me. So I did just that.

Lucy apologized for talking too much about this and for her exes bothering me. This she said ""anyways thanks for listening"" which was weird. I was scared that she was taking it the wrong way when I asked her to talk about her exes less so I sent her other messages telling her that I'd like to still be friends with her and that she's really cool I just wanted a few boundaries. She read them but didn't respond. Mira suggested to leave Lucy alone for a few days since she might still be processing it.

The day after, I decided to try to speak to Lucy again, but she acted cold towards me and brushed me off. I felt horrible, but I thought that if she only ever wanted to talk to me to vent about her love life, then maybe we shouldn't be friends at all so I stopped talking to her. Then yesterday, she texted me suddenly, so I replied. She then asked to me to spy on one of her exes, as if the whole conversation never happened. So I stopped responding to her.

Today, I told some of my other friends about what happened over the last week. The majority of them think that I was in the wrong and that I should've just let Lucy vent. They are all against me, except for Lucy's ex-best friend and Mira, who think that I did the right thing. But now I feel awful since Lucy was so kind and that she already lost a whole bunch of friends. But I also didn't want to talk about her ex-boyfriends anymore.

"My sister (33/f) is an alcoholic and doesn't think she has a problem. She binge drinks and becomes incredibly cruel and disrespectful to everyone around her. She is also very reckless.

My sister and I went on vacation last week. After dinner my sister and I parted ways. It was only 7;30pm but I was exhausted and I went back to the hotel and she went to a bar. She texted me around midnight saying she was going to another bar and would be back by 2am. Then I never heard from her until noon the following day. My texts went unanswered and she was not picking up her phone.

She did not know anyone in town and I assumed she was with someone random but I started seriously thinking about contacting the police to ask them what my next steps were because I was also thinking of worst case scenario. She is extremely vulnerable when she drinks and yet she thinks she is invincible.

My last text said ""if I don't hear from you in a few hours I am calling the police."" My sister finally texted me back at noon saying ""huh? why the police? I am fine."" Then she went awol again , ignored all my texts asking her when she would be back and didn't come back to the room until after 7pm.

When she got back she was unapologetic and resentful. She did not give any explanation as to where she was. She was mad I contacted our parents and she said I was dramatic for wanting to call the police.

She binge drinks and becomes incredibly cruel and disrespectful to everyone around her. She is also very reckless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sister and I went on vacation last week. After dinner my sister and I parted ways. It was only 7;30pm but I was exhausted and I went back to the hotel and she went to a bar. She texted me around midnight saying she was going to another bar and would be back by 2am. Then I never heard from her until noon the following day. My texts went unanswered and she was not picking up her phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did not know anyone in town and I assumed she was with someone random but I started seriously thinking about contacting the police to ask them what my next steps were because I was also thinking of worst case scenario. She is extremely vulnerable when she drinks and yet she thinks she is invincible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last text said &amp;quot;if I don&amp;#39;t hear from you in a few hours I am calling the police.&amp;quot; My sister finally texted me back at noon saying &amp;quot;huh? why the police? I am fine.&amp;quot; Then she went awol again , ignored all my texts asking her when she would be back and didn&amp;#39;t come back to the room until after 7pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she got back she was unapologetic and resentful. She did not give any explanation as to where she was. She was mad I contacted our parents and she said I was dramatic for wanting to call the police. A few days later she had another outburst about this and she is mad I don&amp;#39;t treat her like an adult and she said I watch too many tv shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AITB for being worried and wanting to contact the police? I know I am one for going on vacation with her in the first place. Those days are over.&lt;/p&gt;

"2 years ago when i was 13 I cut my first friend in highschool(John 14M then) out of my life, in some ways he went from being serious all the time to completely annoying always coming up with a obvious lie that he claims was his way of joking, it didn't help much that he was wild and would take things too far like overdoing the constant quoting of shows and movies and on one occasion he ended accidentally up hurting one of our friends when they were rough housing.I told John some hurtful things and blocked him on all social media I personally didn't know or cared that me cutting him out of my life would cause everyone else to drop him all the same, they often made comments about how he was always sitting alone at lunch or how they never invite him anywhere. even after dropping him he tried for months to make amends but I was just not having it.

3 months ago I found out that John made a new group of friends and one of them(Jane 15F) just so happens to be someone I talk to online(she only talked to me because John told her about me). when we met in person she was with her group of friends including John, John treated me like always, happy to see me and I acted like nothing happened between us. 

Not surprising John's new friends also hate him but the only difference is they bully him because they think he is childish because he is always happy. it only took a while for John to finally let what I did to him overtake his constant happiness, due to the constant bullying and everyone treating me better than him, John spoke his mind and told me he doesn't want a repeat of last time where everyone is nice to me but hate him, he also doesn't want to spend another 2 years alone, he gave me the same treatment I did where he blocked me I tried to apologies like he did years ago but he didn't care. his new friends all messaged me and told me to not pay him any mind but my sister told me it was Karma?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-03-03T22:38:19.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 years ago when i was 13 I cut my first friend in highschool(John 14M then) out of my life, in some ways he went from being serious all the time to completely annoying always coming up with a obvious lie that he claims was his way of joking, it didn&amp;#39;t help much that he was wild and would take things too far like overdoing the constant quoting of shows and movies and on one occasion he ended accidentally up hurting one of our friends when they were rough housing.I told John some hurtful things and blocked him on all social media I personally didn&amp;#39;t know or cared that me cutting him out of my life would cause everyone else to drop him all the same, they often made comments about how he was always sitting alone at lunch or how they never invite him anywhere. even after dropping him he tried for months to make amends but I was just not having it.&lt;/p&gt;

"Earlier this week, I caught my wife being involved with another guy, and planning on divorcing me. As far as I know, it's only been an ""emotional affair"", but it's still a pretty awful thing to do. We live together with our child, but I have told her to find a new place, and she is actively looking for one. I'm trying to remain amicable, if only for the good of our child. We still share our living space, and continue to hang out in the evening, honestly not much different than our ""marriage"" has been for the last year. Things have been on the rocks for some time, and there's been a lack of any intimacy, and I'm not even just talking about sex. So, par for the course on just hanging out watching TV and sharing memes in bed. 

I told her yesterday that I was struggling that day more than I had been. She asked if I needed some space and I asked for some time alone, but that we could hang out and watch our show later. I've been pretty calm about the whole thing throughout this week. Like I said, writing had been on the wall as far as our marriage ending. When we started hanging out later I told her that I'm not struggling with the divorce decision as much, but what I am having a hard time with is her affair. I told her I'm pretty chill about us continuing to be around each other, but what makes it hard for me is when I see her on her phone talking to her ""new guy"". She said she understood how that could be hard and she recognizes how it hurts me.

So, we're chilling, watching AHS, and what is she doing the entire time? She's on her phone texting with the jerk non stop. I wanted to just tell her to get out if that's what she wants to do, that she doesn't get to have both a comfortable ""friendly"" relationship at home with me, and continue to hurt me and talk to this guy that ""makes her feel good, like she hasn't felt in a long time"". I feel like it's a serious lack of respect. I know I can't tell her what to do as far as ""don't talk to him anymore/in front of me"", and that she's gonna do what she's gonna do, but am I being an asshole if I tell her she can't be in the same room if that's what she'd rather do?

To reiterate, I'm trying to keep things on as good of terms as possible because of our child. I grew up with divorced parents, and I know what it's like to be split between two people that don't like each other. Ideally we remain friends and can do things together with our child so that he gets to feel that love and support from us and not feel part of a conflict. It will obviously take some time, but that is how we've discussed we'd like to see this end up.

Also, for the sake of transparency, I found out what was going on by looking through her messages after I became suspicious. Not the best side of me, but I think comparatively, it's small potatoes to what she's been doing. I just don't want to paint myself as some saint who has been the perfect partner the whole time.

"Me and my friend were walking around late at night looking for an Uber after a music festival, and we walked into a pretty sketchy neighborhood without knowing it. It was an unknown area for both of us and we were just trying to get away from the crowd to try to get a Better deal on the Uber. As we are waiting on a corner I see a guy walking towards us looking super sketchy, turning his head in all directions looking for cops maybe or just anxious because he is about to pull a gun on us. 

As he approaches I’m already on a defensive Stand and actually slowly steeping back. Not my first rodeo you know. But my friend is probably still high or something and when the guy asks us if we are coming from the event, my friend even gets a little closer to him and tries to have a conversation with a random sketchy dude at 2am in a ghetto neighborhood. 
He then says take everything out of your pockets and put it on the floor. I’m already ready to square up with him, and I say nah bro go away. He then reaches to his pocket and as soon as I see him pull a gun, my first instinct is just to run away. At this point my friend because he approached him to try to have a conversation he is way closer to him than me, so basically just cornered him and single him out. He took my friend’s wallet and phone. I stayed closed by and had 911 ready to dialed, but he just took my friend’s things and left. I do think my friend has no survival instincts, but I guess people react differently to dangerous situations like this. 

Any input is appreciated, we haven’t really talked since it happened. So just want to get other people’s opinions if I was really in the wrong. Thanks.

"Context: I have been making music for fun for 5+ years and have always had the goal of eventually making a living from it. I talk to various producers that are still fairly underground, there’s one that I talk to occasionally through text message and I have bought beats from him before. 

I showed my very close friend one of his beats as we were riding in the car one night talking about music and our goals with it. Fast forward to today we are messing around recording (on my studio equipment, he doesn’t have any of his own) and he has headphones on so I can only somewhat make out what he’s hearing. He pulls up a beat (the beat I had played for him once) and starts recording on it, He asked me to mix it because I have a lot more experience with it and I did, but then I started thinking about how I had showed him this beat and had plans of using it for myself for my own music.

 AITA for not letting him use it for himself? I am willing to maybe put him on the song as a feature and release it for myself but I dont think I can sleep happily knowing my friend is benefiting off of my ideas that he knows have been in the works for years. We do have other songs together but he has released all of them and I still haven’t gotten any. This one is special to me and my personal artistic style that I have been developing, and he would not know this beat even existed if it wasn’t for me showing him so thats why I’m very torn about it.

Should probably be mentioned that this is a friend I do share similar goals with and would of course like to maintain a working relationship with when it comes to music. And the song he recorded is still very incomplete. I just don’t know how to word it if I do decide to not let him release it. Any input is appreciated.

Edit: I do not exclusively own the beat (yet at least), but I am the only one with contact to the producer, my friend was previously completely unaware of the producer and is still unaware of who exactly he is or where to find any similar beats because it is a very particular sound.

"Hi Reddit! 
I (24F) am friends with D (24M) and Ri (23M) for 5 years now. D and Ri have always been there for me, supporting and taking care of me. 6 months ago we along with our group went to a club. That night I was suppose to stay with a friend (24F) as there was some issue at my apartment. But as we all got super drunk, she went home with her bf and Ri offered me to stay at his place and I agreed. I don't remember very clearly but I do remember us making out at one point of time that night. We stopped when I realised what was happening. It was very awkward the next day and I acted as I don't remember anything. But later on I did talk to him and asked him about it. Apparently he was so drunk that he didn't even remember it. So in the end we decided that it was just a drunken mistake and move forward.
Now back to the main story. I have known Z for last 2 years. He was our college junior and is in his last year of college rn (He isn’t close with Ri and D). Few months back he told me that he likes me and I decided to give it a chance. But we decided not to tell anyone until his college gets over. 
This month he was visiting my city for a week. He was staying with his friends. We spend some quality time. On the last day of his stay, I threw a party and invited our friends. Everything went fine. At the end Ri and D were too drunk to drive so they stayed back. 
The next day I was texting to Z and he said that he was really uncomfortable last night. I got worried so asked what made him feel so. But he wont give a clear reply. At the end I got annoyed and just said that this isn't the way to communicate and he would have to at least tell me what made him feel so for me to do anything. He got angry and said the reason should be obvious to me. My first thought was that he was uncomfortable because of Ri and I would have been understanding about it but till that point I was slightly angry due to him just beating around the bush. I tried explaining to him that there is nothing between us and we are just friends and that incident a drunken mistake. He started saying that there are other reasons as well. Though it was a major one. He had problems with D and Ri both, them taking care of me while I was drunk and obviously them staying back. But again this is nothing new. They have been protective towards me since always and even Z knew that. He even said that he doesn't like me hanging out with them. It was then that I snapped and said that they are my friends and I am not ending my friendship because he was uncomfortable with it and it was some thing that he needed to work on. At last I said that we should end things if he doesn't trust me. He asked if I wanted to break up. I said yeah I want to break up if he doesn't trust me. He got angry and blocked me. 
So AITB for ending things especially after he came to visit me? 
I'm asking this here because I sometime become extremely protective towards my friends. And wanted some opinions regarding this as most of my friends don't know I was dating him.

I (24F) am friends with D (24M) and Ri (23M) for 5 years now. D and Ri have always been there for me, supporting and taking care of me. 6 months ago we along with our group went to a club. That night I was suppose to stay with a friend (24F) as there was some issue at my apartment. But as we all got super drunk, she went home with her bf and Ri offered me to stay at his place and I agreed. I don&amp;#39;t remember very clearly but I do remember us making out at one point of time that night. We stopped when I realised what was happening. It was very awkward the next day and I acted as I don&amp;#39;t remember anything. But later on I did talk to him and asked him about it. Apparently he was so drunk that he didn&amp;#39;t even remember it. So in the end we decided that it was just a drunken mistake and move forward.
Now back to the main story. I have known Z for last 2 years. He was our college junior and is in his last year of college rn (He isn’t close with Ri and D). Few months back he told me that he likes me and I decided to give it a chance. But we decided not to tell anyone until his college gets over. 
This month he was visiting my city for a week. He was staying with his friends. We spend some quality time. On the last day of his stay, I threw a party and invited our friends. Everything went fine. At the end Ri and D were too drunk to drive so they stayed back. 
The next day I was texting to Z and he said that he was really uncomfortable last night. I got worried so asked what made him feel so. But he wont give a clear reply. At the end I got annoyed and just said that this isn&amp;#39;t the way to communicate and he would have to at least tell me what made him feel so for me to do anything. He got angry and said the reason should be obvious to me. My first thought was that he was uncomfortable because of Ri and I would have been understanding about it but till that point I was slightly angry due to him just beating around the bush. I tried explaining to him that there is nothing between us and we are just friends and that incident a drunken mistake. He started saying that there are other reasons as well.

"Me 20F and my bf 19M have been together for more than a year now and in college in a different state from where my mother lives. My mother 49F came to visit me about two weeks ago. My bf and I don't go to the same college and he lives with his parents and has to stody a lot because of his major, so we only see each other mostly during the weeknds and I usually sleep over at his, since his parents are out of town a lot due to their job. His parents also love me and are happy that I keep him company.

My mom, my brother and I, all went on vacation. I am not proud to say that my mother payed for my trip, since I didnt have the money at that time, but I have already started to save up and have been for quite some time now, in order to repay her. I had offered to pay for my trip when we booked it and I had the money, but she refused and I had to spend my savings for utilities and stuff, since I rent an apartment.

During the trip I had an awersome time and didn't spend nearly enough time talking to my bf, only about half an hour at night when she was doing other things. My mother was really obnoxious for the whole trip and acted like a knowitall, so sometimes I was evidently annoyed.

During visting a museum, I pointed out that we were going to the wrong direction and she blew out on me and told how annoying and ungrateful I was and my brother told me to go away and not talk to them. Upon returning to the hotel, they repeated how ungrateful and a brat I was and that I wan ruining their vacation and that they didn't want me there anymore. She also told me that she's waiting for us to break up, because then I would be alone and not act like I do right now.

After a few weeks, I went to visit them relunctantly, but I had already paid for my trip so it would be wasted money not to go and I didn't want to start anything else. I was obviously not in a great mood, because of what had happened, for which neither of them had apologised.

They were planning another trip, to which I wouldn't go and she got mad at me. I justified my opinion but she again lashed out on me, raging about my relationship. She also mentioned that she knows why my bf's parents were okay with me staying over and that I was blind not to have seen it, but when I asked her why, she said tahat she will let me figure that out in myself (if your have any idea lmk, I am really curious, even though I of course don't believe such thing).

During the conversation she cried a lot told me a lot of offensive stuff, as well as things about me that are false and triend to guilt trip me. I was very mad, but never raised my tone and only pointed out valid arguments. My bf said that he was also a bit annoyed because of the picture she painted him and his family, but ultimately told me that maybe she was still adjusting to me not living at home any more and the change that had brought to my mother's and my relationship.

"TLDR: 

Made a joke about a coworker who make inappropriate jokes getting in trouble for sexual harassment and got  yelled at for it.

  


Full Context:

My supervisor had announced that she would be shuffling our seating arrangements so that i and the other juniors could be positively influenced be our seniors on the team.

When they announced that Tiff(F20) would be placed next to Vick(M32) I made the comment to Tiff that Vick would need a lawyer soon and when she asked why I explained ""for the sexual harassment suite you'll be filing against him within a week"". As far as I can tell she took the joke pretty well considering how she doubled over and started slapping her knee but when she tells Tay(F22) another of the juniors on the team the joke that's when things get weird. Tay immediately defends Vick telling me how it's inappropriate to make a joke like that about someone I work with, which would be fair if Vick had never said anything that could be seen as sexual harassment but he damn well has and in front of the entire team including our supervisor.

This is the guy who's made poorly veiled r word jokes towards female coworkers on the team and has jokingly suggested scenarios where he's threatened to assault or otherwise coerce female coworkers into doing favors for other male coworkers if they paid him. He once said to Saph(F19) ""oh the things i would do to you if the r word was legal"" and to Cal(M23) ""for $5k I'll get Kim(F24) to show up at your front door any night you want"". He's said shit like this in full earshot of not just our entire team but everyone on the production floor.

So I was a little surprised that Tay would defend him when she knows exactly why I'd make a joke like this. It gets worse because when Vick gets back from his lunch break Tay doesn't waste any time telling him what I said causing him to lean over the cubical wall and start yelling at me about accusing him of sexual harassment. Then when I point out some of what he's said his response is basically that I should mind my own business and if what he's saying is so bad why have none of the girls on the team reported him. He then sits down and starts complaining about me to another guy on the team who's giving him full support and saying stuff along the lines of I'm a dick for not minding my own business and that I'm not worth the time.

What's worse is the response from Tay, during training she and some other girls in our training group singled out this guy on our team and were saying shit behind his back. To quote them directly ""he looks like a r\*\*ist"" and ""i could feel him undress me with his eyes"". All this guy did was dose off staring in the general direction of one of the girls in our training group and that was enough to have this group of girls say these things about him. So color me surprised when Tay a girl from this same group can hear the stuff that Vick says and somehow defend him.

"My childhood friends are drifting away from me. I keep acing tests in my college and am getting top 10 ranks in most of them (out of 7000). I recently aced a state level olympiad. My mom was happy about this and posted it on her story. My friends saw it and started trolling me on my social media.

They called me a scholar, but in the most mocking tone possible. Initially I'd planned to not tell them at all because most of them aren't academically blessed. We have been friends since we were like 3, and I've always been better at studies in that group. They never treated me any differently for it before. Idk what different now.

They asked me tutor them but all they did was throw snide remarks at me all the time. When i tried to explain something they'd say: ""don't assume it's easy for everyone"".
It was a very easy topic. I knew that she knew it too. It made me feel like I was the one undermining them and acting oversmart.

"I (73M) am in the middle of clearing out my late parents' house, and there's a lot of emotion involved in the job. My mom and dad moved here 71 years ago when I was just two, and this is the house where  I and my younger brother and sister grew up. My mom died seven years ago at 93, and my father lived here on his own until last October when he passed at an even one hundred.

This morning I found a locked suitcase among my father's effects. It wasn't just secured by the suitcase's built-in lock; he'd  managed to add a big combination lock to its defenses. This was very unlike my father, who kept boxes and boxes of letters and files and never displayed the slightest concern about security. So the lock piqued my curiosity and I started to wonder if there were any way to open the suitcase without damaging it.

I needn't have worried – as soon as I picked it up, the ancient suitcase fell apart in my hands. The cardboard back fell off entirely, spilling dozens of letters out on the floor. Every one was from my mother to her boyfriend and eventual husband, my dad. I haven't counted them all up but it appears possible that she wrote him a letter every day while he was away in the war.  The early ones were addressed to Pvt Bondigass at some stateside camp or other; the later ones to a Staff Sergeant  by that name somewhere in Europe. Apparently he'd saved every one from the time he enlisted until he came home. 

I read just a few of the letters. My mom poured out her heart about the good and the bad things going on in her life, but always came back to one point: she loved this guy a whole lot and she missed him terribly. It's strange: I never knew those two young sweethearts; I just knew Mom and Dad. It goes without saying that I'll be saving these letters, but I'm not sure how many more of them I'll be reading. Part of me wants to simply find a new box and seal up the letters again, but I'm a historian by profession and I've always been eager to learn how living through the Second World War affected both of them. It seems to me that this trove of letters is a resource that shouldn't be wasted, but part of me wonders if I'd be a buttface for reading them.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-29T04:41:12.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (73M) am in the middle of clearing out my late parents&amp;#39; house, and there&amp;#39;s a lot of emotion involved in the job.

"I(19) met my friend M(19) in 2023 online, and while we got along, there were some issues that arose over time. M seemed more invested in the friendship than I was, often unwilling to compromise and frequently venting about their struggles, which became overwhelming for me. Despite my own mental health challenges, I supported them as best I could, but it became draining when every conversation revolved around their problems.

Despite my discomfort, I tried to maintain the friendship until my own mental health took a nosedive due to unrelated events. Upon reflection, I realized how much stress M's constant complaints were causing me, so I decided to end the friendship. Instead of abruptly cutting ties, I sent a letter explaining my reasons and wished them well in finding someone better suited to their needs.

It's important to note that only one week has passed since I sent the letter.

Furthermore, I attempted to open up about my own issues, but M always seemed uncomfortable or sad and needed to end the conversation, which made me feel like I was oversharing, even though they regularly shared much more intimate details of their life.

Additionally, M would message me at least three times a day for no particular reason, often questioning my actions or whereabouts, such as if I mentioned I was in bed.

Despite my efforts to address the situation, I had brought up many times that they seemed to only complain and didn't seem to be making any actual changes to help things get better. However, every time I did, they just dismissed my concerns, claiming I was being mean or didn't understand.

While I unfriended them on social media, I didn't block their number. Initially, they responded positively, mentioning they would seek help for their mental health struggles, but recently, they reached out, questioning why I gave up on them. They argued that they were worth being friends with because of their kindness and support for others, trying to persuade me to reconsider.

Despite their pleas, I'm not entirely sure about my decision, as I do value the friendship we had, but I believe it was necessary for my well-being. So, Reddit, AITB for ending the friendship because it was detrimental to my mental health?

"So last weekend me and my friends decided to go to the beach. One of the guys brought a spike ball net with him and we decided to play a few rounds of spike ball. While we were playing, a little kid wandered up to us. One of my friends asked if he wanted to play, and I immediately told him no because he's a tiny child playing with fully grown men and he could get hurt, and that he would force us to be more cautious and ruin our fun.

My friend asked what my problem was and I repeated that he's a little kid and should play with people his age and not a bunch of grown men and that he should go back to his parents. I said that I was going to find a life guard or beach patrol and ask them to help find the kid's parents because it looked like he had wandered over on his own.

"“Amy” and I work together. We would often chat through the night outside of work. I liked talking to her but wasn’t sure what I felt. Eventually, she told me she had feelings for me. I wasn’t sure about getting into a relationship with a coworker, and I expressed all of my concerns. We decided to just be friends. 

A few weeks later, I realized I was not attracted to Amy. She’s a little heavier, and just not my type. I decided to go out on a few dates with “Sarah” instead, who is another coworker. Amy is pissed that I went out with another coworker after telling her we can’t date because we work together. 

The truth is, I just don’t see myself with Amy, but I don’t want to hurt her feelings. I did establish that we’re just friends, and I think that should be enough. Amy feels that I lead her on with the idea that we could maybe date in the future, and that my only constraint was our working together.

"My(38F) friends had made plans to take me out for my birthday weekend and my ex-husband(40M) and ex-boyfriend(37M) were asked to take their respective kids in my absence. out of the two only my ex-husband came to pick up his son(12M) while Ex-boyfriend had other plans, devastated by the change of plans I thought it would be best for my daughter(7F) to go with my ex-husband even though they are not related by blood. Ex-husband took me up on the offer and took my daughter with him and our son, I can see she was afraid of him so I prayed nothing bad would happen to her.

It seems their weekend was a great one because when she returned all she could talk about was how my Ex-husband was fun and the things they did like play video-games, dnd and whatever, she even showed me one of those plastic build it yourself toys she received as a gift. one problem with my daughter is that she can never keep a secret no matter what, her father came to visit this afternoon and she told him about her weekend with my ex-husband, at first he did not care but slowly he became upset, he yelled at me and told me I was wrong to let his daughter go with my ex-husband of all people, he even confiscated the toy she got as a gift and demanded I return it, he made our daughter cry so she told him she wished that my ex-husband was her real dad. one thing lead to another, he threatened me with the police if I ever let another man look after his daughter and now we are here.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-27T03:24:52.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My(38F) friends had made plans to take me out for my birthday weekend and my ex-husband(40M) and ex-boyfriend(37M) were asked to take their respective kids in my absence. out of the two only my ex-husband came to pick up his son(12M) while Ex-boyfriend had other plans, devastated by the change of plans I thought it would be best for my daughter(7F) to go with my ex-husband even though they are not related by blood.

"I (F 19) want to break up with my long-distance bf Greg (M 19). We've only been together a couple of months. He wanted us to get Life360 a little while ago. We live a couple of states away, so I thought maybe it was just kind of a symbol of trust, so I agreed.

Almost immediately, it felt like there were problems. The app was saying I was walking right outside of my dorm if I went to use my communal bathroom at night or even just sleeping, and that was an issue for Greg a couple of times. I told Greg I had a problem with this. Greg said he'd try not to get so worked up about it.

But, last night/this morning, my location appeared as ""off/no network."" I didn't do anything to my phone, so I don't know. I barely even look at the app. But, this was ""concerning"" to Greg.

I went to bed around 10:30 pm, and I woke up at about 11:00 am to a screenshot of my location being turned off since 6:30 pm (just wanted to add that I HAD texted him after that time). The screenshots would be too much to add, but we went back and forth through paragraphs of arguing over text.

Greg felt I was blowing everything out of proportion, and the only reason I felt upset was because of my experiences with my ex. Greg said he was just worried about me, he thought something bad had happened, and I had made a huge problem out of nothing. To me, it felt like he was just trying to minimize anything wrong he had done while still apologizing to make me feel bad for saying anything.

I told Greg I was tired of him acting accusatory or argumentative but backtracking and feigning innocence when I called him out on it. I also said that I am not helpless and traumatized, and I've been alive this long and have managed to take care of myself well enough, and my problems with him had nothing to do with my ex and everything to do with him. I also added I was tired of having to prove myself to him.

For a little context (I guess?), he told me before being together, he had trust issues with previous exes, which I agreed to work through with him. This is not the only time we have had issues with him ""trusting"" me. We have not met in real life but were trying to plan a trip to see each other. He is from my state but moved a while ago.

I don't like the feelings this has left me with. I didn't go into depth with what was said, but his language felt really manipulative. No matter what I'll be breaking up with him, but WIBTA for doing so?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-28T00:02:52.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (F 19) want to break up with my long-distance bf Greg (M 19).

"Headsup, throwaway account. 

I (23F) recently moved out of an apartment that I shared with one other person (38F). It was my first apartment after moving out of my parents house and I thought I had found a great deal for the town that I live in (obviously not sharing the town because I would like to remain as anonymous as I can. Also, be safe on the internet friends 🧡),  the rent was right in my budget, and it was really close to where I was working, and it was also close to my parents that I could easily visit but it was still far enough so I had my own space. 

The door to my room had a lock with a keyhole on it and I had the key to the door that I was given when I moved in. I lock my door everyday when I leave for work because I wanted to keep my space private since it was the room I was paying for. 

Fast forward about 10.5, 11 months into living in this apartment, one night I accidentally end up locking myself out of my bedroom while under the influence of weed and I try to lock pick my way back into my room, (not the smartest plan I know but as I mentioned before I was high) anyways, my roommate came out of her room and asked what I was doing. I explain that I had locked myself out of my room and was trying to get back in, she then goes back into her bedroom and comes back with a key that unlocks MY bedroom door and let's me back into again, MY room. I ended up falling asleep shortly after the incident and decided to bring it up to her after I had sobered up in the morning. 

When I tried to bring it up the following morning she best me to the punch and said that the reason why she had a key to my room was because ""my room used to be her drum studio"". I had been wanting to leave this apartment for a while and knowing that my roommate had a key to MY bedroom and could've possibly been in my room without my knowledge but also that she didn't think to tell me that she even had a key until I had lived there for almost a year, I am still convinced that if I had not locked myself out out that night I would still be ignorant to this horrific fact. 

The day that I moved out I left a note hidden in the bedroom closet (I placed it in-between the shelf and the wall about halfway) and it read ""just so you know, Roommate has a key to YOUR room.""

Maybe I'm just being paranoid but I found it really creepy that my roommate (who is 15 years older than I am) thought it was a good idea to have a key to my bedroom and never tell me.

"I have really bad sensory issues when it comes to certain sounds. One of these is people chewing loudly and the other is people biting their nails. For me it's like nails on a chalkboard and they are just sounds I can't be around. 

My girlfriend bites her nails which is something I didn't realise she did often when we first got together but since we weren't living together. We were on a date once and she started biting them and I asked if she could stop and explained how much I hate the sound. She apologised and agreed to not bite her nail around me. 

We moved in together 9 months ago and I noticed she was starting to bite them a lot more frequently. I asked her again if she could not do it when I'm around. She ended up getting her nails done regularly which meant she stopped biting them at all for a while. More recently though she's started biting even her nails even with the nail polish and whatever else gets put on them when she gets them done. 

She'll do this on an evening when we're together. Last night I asked her again to stop biting them, we were sat watching tv and all I could hear was her biting her nails. She said it shouldn't be a problem but I reminded her of how bad the sound makes me feel. Later on in the night we're talking about something else and she just stops halfway through a sentence to bite her nails. 

I ask again if she minds not doing that and a min later she does it again so I walk out of the room. She asks where I'm going and I just say I'm not going to be in the room when she's biting her nails since she knows how the sounds makes me feel. I pointed out she shouldn't be stopping in the middle of conversations to sit and bite her nails. 

She said I was being unreasonable and petty but I don't think I am. She knows how the sound makes me feel so I shouldn't have to sit and listen to it.

Facts

We've been together for 4y. We have ups and downs... but i always felt she was a disconnected woman. Perhaps her libido was down... dunno. I've talked to her about this, how it affects my self esteem, multiple times. We're in the 30s/40s

One day i found out she was texting a ex-worker, with a speech not really proper for friends. I got pissed off, she promissed me she would never speak to him again. Chance nr1.

One month later, i caught her speaking to him again... and planing to meet with him. She begged again... Chance nr.2

On eve of the new year, i found out that she had met with her ex boyfriend (along with a friend of hers, female as well)... to discuss a court issue over violence (on his part) where she was put as a witness. This has been going on since May. We didn't entered the year together... i had to get away. I was furious... but i relented... chance Nr.3

Today was my 1st day of work after two weeks of vacations, with her. The first week was OK, she had booked a SPA at a thermal place for valentines for both of us. The second week she was distant. Claimed it was headcaches due to TPM etc... i've seen this movie before... but let it slide.

So today, she had her eyelashes done in the morning. In the afternoon.. she told me she was going to her father coffee. She told me he was more talkative than usual... oh well.

I found out she was not on her father coffee... she lied to me and went to visit some Big Brother VIP at her herb shop or something...

I'm finding very very hard to trust her, she asks me to think about what we've built together... but if we had actually built something of value, would she throw it away like this ?

"Okay, so for some context before I start, I (16M) have had lower back pain for the last 3-4 years, worsening over the years. I went to my family doctor about this several times, each time him giving me a different reason why it hurt, sometimes telling me it’s growing pains, telling me it might just be psychological or simply telling me to lose weight (I’ve lost 15 pounds and was and still am healthy despite the back pain). Recently I came to my doctor again for a different problem, mentioning the back pain again, he told me again that I just needed to lose more weight. I snapped at him and essentially told him I lost weight and it did nothing except make my back pain worse, then I asked for a spinal x-ray to make sure nothing was wrong. Doc told me he didn’t want to expose me to unneeded radiation and so I shouldn’t get it, I said I still wanted one so he agreed but warned me sternly about unnecessary radiation exposure.

"&amp;#x200B;

I (26m) have two daughters. Oldest is 8, and youngest is 1.5. Let's call them Em and Bo.

Em and I were estranged for a while as she is from a previous relationship but recently she has been living with me as her mom fell on hard times. Bo is GF and I's child.

As of right now, I am unemployed as we could not afford childcare services, and Bo was a surprise. GF made a lot more than me, so I ended up being the SAHD.

This is a lot to juggle right now. To start off, Em is extremely picky and a bit spoiled as she grew up with her wealthy mother and her family members. Both GF and I can't afford the lifestyle she is used to, so she is very resentful of us. Bo on the other hand cannot sleep at night and is up all night distraught and I am up with her getting no sleep at all.

Naturally, because of this I am usually too exhausted to cook, or do time-consuming chores. My GF understood my struggles at first but recently since Em started living with us she's been very irritable. I assumed she'd be more understanding as now I have two children to take care of by my own, but she's been making snide and hurtful comments.

Most of these comments imply I am lazy and not trying which is not the case at all. I'm trying my hardest but really right now some ramen and chicken noodle soup is the best I can do for dinner when I can barely feed myself.

Last week she just seemed on edge for days. One night when she came home, I forgot to clean up me and the kids dinners from the coffee table (and I will admit, it did look pretty bad because Bo had knocked the bowls down) and blew up at me and cried.

I tried to soothe her but she was screaming that I was lazy and deadbeat and how could I do this to her. I told her to calm down so we could talk and she said she was done. I was shocked and asked what she meant and she said she was leaving me and didn't want Bo to be ""neglected"" by me any longer.

I begged her to reason but she ignored me the entire time as she packed her and Bos bags and began to head out the door. I bloced the doorway and yelled and said she was selfish for leaving me alone as I am exhausted and depressed and taking my daughter away. She told me that sentence alone sealed the deal, and left. I've been trying to contact her for days and the most I know is that she's at a hotel and I'm worried sick but don't think I did anything wrong.

"Bit of a long post and I'm horrible at writing texts, so here goes.

I've had a friend (23F) for years now, a really fun person to hang with, we're fwb and we chat nearly every single day. Our friendship has been mostly spotless except for one single sore spot; I always felt like she doesn't trust me. I didn't mind it at first as the friendship was new, but as the years went by it started to slowly bother me more and more.

Now don't get me wrong, I've gone above and beyond forher. I've helped her (and outright paid) for some of her bills when she needed it, been there for her many times and we do A LOT of things together, but...

Everything I ask of her, either out of curiosity or more importance is often met with a ""Nah/No/Can't say"". Oftentimes, very irrelevant information such as ""Oh cool where is this new person from?"" or ""What were you up to today?"" which she often refuses to share or do so as vaguely as possible. Often, it felt as if even the simplest of things I had to pressure and question out of her.

It's gotten to a point where it's just absolutely confusing. She refuses to send me any n\*des whatsoever (her right, I get it) which I find funny considering how often I've seen her naked (completely disregarding the fact she told me she'd sent random strangers nudes before). Hell, the only reason I know where she lives and her full name is because I offered to pay an outstanding bill for her.

Add to the confusion, she has confessed to me that she has a crush on me many times for nearly 2 years now, but I simply cannot date someone that acts like they don't trust me. All of this would sometimes turn into small arguments where she'd give someone the answer, but with me it was always a ""Nah..."". She also insists that she does trust me and has gotten upset before over me thinking otherwise.

Cut to today, I was fixing something bank-related for her, and I was asked a security question; ""Name of childhood best friend"". So naturally, I asked her the answer and she simply would not answer. This is me, fixing and shelling out money to cover something for her, with her ACCOUNT, ACCOUNT NUMBER and PASSWORD, full control of her account as is, and she simply doesn't want to tell me the answer.

This leads to me asking her what possible reason can she have for doing this now, and she said ""If I say it, it's gonna sound bad"". So I insisted that she did and her answer was; ""I trust too easy so I'm basically trying to fix that and you're my practice in a way"". That felt like a massive punch to the face. I've been nothing short of the best friend I can possibly be to someone and that answer just made me feel used.

So I just told her to go f\* herself and stormed off. She tried talking to me but I just turned off my phone. No matter how hard I try to rationalize this, it just feels like completely selfish of her considering I've voiced MANY TIMES that her acting that way made me feel shitty. AITB?

Edit: so people don't die on this hill; we made plenty of s\*x videos, I only added the n\*des part to exemplify how weird her boundaries with me are.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-27T00:41:37.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bit of a long post and I&amp;#39;m horrible at writing texts, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

My Dad told me he doesn't like my bangs, and that they were uneven. I cut them myself, but they didn't look too uneven and I was happy with my hair. 
And a couple of days later, he took me to get a bang trim, that ended up being about half an inch, possibly more, off of my bangs. The minute I got home I was bawling. I cannot describe how bad it looked. 
I have had my fair share of bullies, but they mostly backed off. Now, Im afraid of being bullied again. 
My Mom aksed me to not be mad at him because ""hes a guy"". 
I showed my friends, their reactions weren't good. 
And the only way my hair looks good is if I put it in a ponytail, then I look like an anime character. 

I am cutting this very short and brief because I already wrote past the character limit, and I don't want to do that again. 

But, do i have the right to be mad at my Dad? (I will answer questions in the comments)

EDIT

I didn't mention that i repeatedly said ""I like my hair"" and ""I dont want the haircut"" . 
My Dad said ""You're just saying that because you want to stay home"" 
Even when we were in the car, about to go inside the 'salon', I again said ""I don't want my hair cut"" but he didn't listen and made me go anyway. 

So I did not agree to the haircut, I was dragged there then I got too scared to tell the stylist (or my Dad) that i really didn't want my bangs to be cut. So I let it happen and didn't speak up whatsoever. I know thats probably my fault, I should've spoken up, but I kinda feel I shouldn't have been there in the first place.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-26T05:37:09.000Z","post","META","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Dad told me he doesn&amp;#39;t like my bangs, and that they were uneven.

"My girlfriend and I mentioned we wanted to have more quality time together without using phones etc. We said we'd go on more dates but also have more nights in where we choose a movie to watch and get popcorn and other snacks etc. 

At the weekend we chose a movie and my girlfriend kept picking her phone up and scrolling social media. I asked if she minded not using her phone since it was supposed to be the point of us spending time together and not using phones. She said she's not on it long so it shouldn't matter. She kept picking it up again and scrolling social media so I paused the movie. 

My girlfriend said that's not necessary and to not pause it. I asked her again if she'd stop using her phone and she said she wasn't using much. Around 5-10 mins later she pick her phone up again and scrolls social media. At this point I turned the movie off and said she clearly wasn't interested.

She accused me of ruining the night by turning it off but I just pointed out she obviously didn't actually care about watching the movie since she spent more time on her phone. She just repeated I didn't have to turn it off and that it was me who ruined the night.

"My (26F) brother Blake (38M) and his wife Sandra (35F) rent a condo together in a different state. It was hers for two years, but then he got a job and started paying half the rent so it’s equally theirs now. 

Anyway, two years ago, Sandra invited me and my mom (55F) to come stay with them for a visit. We hadn’t seen him in years, and she said she thought it’d be nice to do for the three of us. 

However, she chose to go stay with her sister for the duration. We thought this was strange and kept telling her she didn’t need to leave her own home on our account, but she insisted she preferred it this way because she had severe social anxiety and didn’t know us well. Also not to feel guilty because it was her idea.

Our visit with Blake went great and we all met up with Sandra for lunch one day and it went really great too.

Later that year, we wanted to come again before the holiday. She agreed but still went to stay with her sister. 

A few months later, we wanted to come again, but now Sandra’s sister had moved away, so Sandra had nowhere to run when we came. Blake told us she was nervous about being seen and was worried about how things would go, but she ultimately said ok. This time, me and mom decided to stay for 10 days.

It didn’t go well. Sandra accused me and mom of being rude to her, basically saying we made her feel ignored and disrepected in her own home. She became very stressed  and told Blake it felt like there were strangers in the house.

If we were distant, it was only because we were trying to give her space since she always runs away when we come over. We also didn’t expect her to really try to interact with us, so we were caught off-guard when she did. But we apologized anyway and explained we had social anxiety too.

We thought everything was fine, but it’s been 6 months and we wanna visit again, but Blake said Sandra proposed we do half our stay with them and half at a hotel. Now we feel totally unwelcome, and Blake didn’t like it either. They talked, and ultimately, she agreed to let us stay there the whole time but said we now need to be okay with her being less friendly to us because she doesn’t have the energy to do it if we don’t, and she doesn’t want to feel rejected again. We agreed to this and now it’s booked.

"I'm gonna leave genders and specific ages up in the air as they have  no relevance to the situation, but for some clarity's sake imagine us  all in late 20s or early 30s. Also, apologies for the rambling nature of  my writing, I have never been good at expressing myself through text.   

I've found myself in a hard-to-navigate situation as my friend who likes to share their dating stories and encounters to me sent me a screenie out of the blue of my sibling, who is happily married, on a  dating app they both seem to use. My friend was absolutely shocked and asked me if I knew and all that jazz, which I did not know to be honest. At first my friend assumed my sibling was cheating on their marital partner, but noticed that they have an open relationship status included in the information - section of the app, as with other romantic and  sexual identities, which those I already knew of personally about.   

Now, I'm absolutely NOT a conventional nor a socially normative person myself at all, so this to me personally has zero affect and I do not feel one way or another about it, to put it bluntly. I hope that  doesn't sound dismissive or mean. The problem I have is as follows; I'm wondering should I share with them that against better knowledge I have accidentally stumbled upon this information? Or should I feign  ignorance, or for the lack of better wording, just do nothing about it?  After all, it's not really my business, now is it? Why I'm thinking of talking about it is simply because if my sibling \*feels\* like they have  to hide it, in which case I assume it would be easier on them to know I don't need people to tiptoe around me and they can be themselves freely without restraints (though with an aromantic like me I don't think we would have many one-on-one discussions about relationships of such  nature anyways, which brings me back to not saying anything).   

In short and less rambly way, here is my reasoning for either choice:   

Tell them, because:  
\- Showing openness about the topic  
\- Me being honest and truthful about knowing of it  
\- Letting them know that they can speak freely and not hide it   

Don't tell them, because:  
\- None of my business, quite frankly  
\- Possible discomfort in being outed without consent  
\- I don't know how and when to mention it  
\- It might come off as me trying to seem ""cool"" by being overly supportive and virtue signaling

"For context, I'm a 16 year old male, and I live with my mom. My parents divorced when I was 4 because my dad hit my mom and left. I believe this situation happened when I was 14.

The judge ruled that I had to go to my dad's house over the summer as part of court order.

So now I will explain what happened. I don't remember the exact day, but the day before, my sister asked me and my dad to go on an early morning hike. We agreed. She said to wake her up in the morning early to go on a hike because she wanted to do cardio(not on a tredmill). My dad agreed, and the rest of the day went normal.

So on that day me and my sister and I woke up to my dad crunching on some chips. We didn't like it, so we told him to stop and let us sleep. He said that we agreed to wake up in the morning and go. My sister didn't like that and told him to shut the f up and called him some names. My dad got up and started over to her. 


Anyway, he moves over to her, talking sternly because he doesn't like cursing, I get in the way of him and my sister. My memory goes foggy, but I believe my sister and dad exchange a few more words, and i think my dad threatened her( i dont remember what it was, but i wasn't intimidated by it.

Police come and try to understand what happened. Eventually, my sister said he doesn't feel safe here and packs her things, then leaves. Police asked me if I felt safe, and I said yes. So I stay. At the time, I was super confused and stressed because I didn't know what happened or why it led to this, but I felt like my sister had f'd me over in some way. 

For the rest of the time I was there I had a good time.

After I came back from that break, my Mom tried to talk to me about it, and when I told her that, I thought it was a massive overreaction by my sister. She took my sister's side and said that my dad threatened her to do something, but I told her that she wasn't there and couldn't really defend her. Me and my mom and my sister still disagree with that. I feel like she also guilt tripped me into not talking to my dad because she doesn't like me talking to him at all. She also leveraged this to influence me to stop talking to him. 

Since then, I haven't visited my dad or talked to him since. He tries to text me and have a conversation every couple of months, but I don't respond. I feel like I pause my life in Washington to visit him, and that really isn't fair.I also have found a replacement for him. He is my neighbor. My neighbor has taught me more about how to be a man than my dad had ever, and I've only known him for 3 years.

Still, even with all of that going for me, I still feel conflicted that I made the wrong decision of not talking to my dad for such a long time. I would like to visit him and talk to him but I don't know if it should?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-26T10:08:43.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, I&amp;#39;m a 16 year old male, and I live with my mom. My parents divorced when I was 4 because my dad hit my mom and left. I believe this situation happened when I was 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge ruled that I had to go to my dad&amp;#39;s house over the summer as part of court order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I will explain what happened. I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact day, but the day before, my sister asked me and my dad to go on an early morning hike. We agreed. She said to wake her up in the morning early to go on a hike because she wanted to do cardio(not on a tredmill). My dad agreed, and the rest of the day went normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on that day me and my sister and I woke up to my dad crunching on some chips. We didn&amp;#39;t like it, so we told him to stop and let us sleep. He said that we agreed to wake up in the morning and go. My sister didn&amp;#39;t like that and told him to shut the f up and called him some names. My dad got up and started over to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, he moves over to her, talking sternly because he doesn&amp;#39;t like cursing, I get in the way of him and my sister. My memory goes foggy, but I believe my sister and dad exchange a few more words, and i think my dad threatened her( i dont remember what it was, but i wasn&amp;#39;t intimidated by it. I thought it was him trying to displne he) get and leave out the house and call 911 because she thinks that she&amp;#39;s in danger of getting hurt.  &lt;/p&gt;

My dad and his roomate have been living together for a long time since my mom broke up with my dad. I live with my mom btw and visit my dads house from time to time. I’m now 19 years old and since i was a kid i would visit my dads house and talk to my dads roomate and hang with him. Now times have changed tho and i just don’t really want talk/hang with him all the time plus i got aspergers so i don’t talk much. He knows this too and i explained it to him.

 I think it’s weird for a 19 year old to be hanging around a 60+ year old unless it’s a family member. I notice he is being insecure about it. He acts edgy by giving me this weird side eye, he is staring at me, he constantly asks me why i’m so quiet and i tell him that there’s no reason and he will keep constantly asking to the point where i had to yell at him once cuz it was getting on my nerves. 

After i explained to him why i’m not like who i am back jen he still acts the same. I wanted to have my alone time on my phone and he tells me”are you going to sit with me” and i said i was fine for now and he said “oh ok so you just wanna be all by yourself” in a edgy tone.

"I used to have an etsy store with commissions back in 2021, after the war in Ukraine  I started having personal issues (Editing: to add relevancy. My extended family is Russian&amp;Ukrainian) and I closed the store down. \*6 months\* After I closed the shop I received a message from a woman (Call her Lucy) who said that the dress I made her was the wrong size. I was trying to be nice, so I offered to alter it for Lucy for free., I gave her my phone number since I wasn't on etsy anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Lucy shipped me the dress and after -2 weeks- of back and forth asking Lucy for measurements and what she needed. I finally got her to answer me. (Lucy kept trying to make me guess) After finding out Lucy's new measurements, it became obvious that the dress didn't fit because Lucy originally gave me the wrong measurements (They were off by about 3-4 inches all over) and the dress needed to be completely taken apart, altered and put back together, a process that takes awhile.

&amp;#x200B;

I told Lucy this and Lucy demanded that I finish it in 1 week. I said, ""I will try."" . \*\*Part of the reason I shut the store down is because I just didn't have time.\*\* I tried and every day, multiple times a day Lucy was texting me, demanding that I tell her when it would be done and telling me , I needed to ship it ""ASAP!"". I explained that it was a time extensive process and that I was doing the best and going as fast as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

After about a week Lucy demanded that I finish the dress that day and ship it back the next day. I told her I couldn't do that, Lucy started freaking out and sending me multiple texts and I finally said I can't deal with this, I am sending the dress back unaltered. It took me a few days to sew it back together and Lucy kept texting me demanding I ship it back that day (everyday). The last day It was around 4/5pm and I told her, I can't drive, I needed to wait for my roommate to come home to give me a ride. She told me , ""Walk.""

&amp;#x200B;

I declined to do that and Lucy demanded that I send it the next day and I said okay. It was Sunday, which I realized the next morning, the post office was closed, so I texted her and told Lucy I'd send it Tuesday (monday was a fed holiday) Lucy responded in a slew of texts that she'd waited long enough (It'd been a week and a half since I'd gotten the dress back, not including the time it took to just get her to tell me what she needed fixed. \*All in I think it was about 3ish weeks\* and that she was going to ""File suit against me and sue me."" and tbh I was just exhausted.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know why I was dealing with this when I didn't have to, I didn't know why I was trying so hard to be nice when Lucy was being so entitled and impatient. So I just said, ""Okay I am done. You're driving me nuts, if you're going to threaten me, I am just going to block you. "" so i did. I just blocked Lucy's number.

It's been \*2 years\* Lucy sent me a snail letter today saying she wants a refund because I never returned the dress. I just ignored it.

"Me 18NB

Mom 43F

Dad 42M

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I went to eat before work. I'd gotten myself some food a a bit ago and was craving it. I checked the entire fridge and it was gone.  Now, I was ticked, because that food had cost 10 US$, and I had only eaten a bit. I asked if anyone knew where it was, but no one knew. I looked again before saying ""Screw it, I'll starve."" and going downstairs to my room to cool off. I was watching some YT, trying to distract myself when my mom came in.

She asked if I was ok, which I responded with ""Not really, sorta pissed about this"". she gave me a hug and said she was sorry. I was still a bit upset and asked her to leave me alone, to which she said no, so I left.

I went upstairs again to try and find something to eat, but I gave up, so I closed the fridge and went to head back downstairs. My mom come up and said ""If you had let me finish, you would have heard me say 'If you had labeled it, maybe someone wouldn't have eaten it"" Of course, I was LIVID because why should I have to label my food? I was always under the impression that with any food in the house, we shouldn't eat it if it wasn't ours, and if we wanted to, we asked. I didn't say anything and stormed off, because I was still pissed.

I went back downstairs, ranting to myself as I went before watching more YT. My mom followed. I knew I was still in a bad mood and I really didn't want to fight.

Me: ""Leave me alone""

Mom: ""No""

Me: ""I am not in the mood for this right now, just leave me alone.""

Mom: ""I am not going to leave.""

Me: ""Whats so hard about leaving me alone!? Just get out of my room!""

Mom: ""Thats whats so hard about it! This isn't your room! It's my house""

Now this is when I snapped.

""Fine. If its your house, then Im packing.""

And I did just that. She finally left, scolding me. I responded with ""Im fucking tired of this shit""

Then my dad entered. He said I was 18 and could do what I wanted, but if I moved out, I would have to pay rent if I came back. In my irrational state, I took this as him saying ""I respect the fact you're leaving, but if you want to stay, you pay rent.""

So I kept packing up until I had to work. About an hour into my shift, I had a meltdown and was sent home. I was a manic mess.

My mom asked me if I was ok, to which I said 'no, im homeless. She said something else that I snapped at her for before my dad walked in and sent her away.

My manager had called to see if I was ok, and he was worried, too. He explained to me that I could stay without paying rent, and apologized if anything he said came across as him kicking me out. He kept saying I should take my meds again because this was an extreme response to missing food. I agreed that this would be an extremee response to it if it were just that. I explained that this was because Mom was implying that I don't get privacy because this was her house. He agreed with her, but only slightly. He explained she was worried I would &gt;!kms!&lt;.

I can't help but feel like I'm the AH.

Yesterday I was in band and one of my band mates (who we will call Gianna) was doing certain things incorrect and we politely corrected her saying “Gianna, can you please play a bit softer?” and just things like that. But she kept rolling her eyes at my section leader and ignoring us so it was my job as leader of second altos to help out, so I gently told her to fix certain mistakes.

But she gave me the same attitude so after class I talked to my band director in private; this is where I think I may have been in the wrong, so i told my band director about her attitude towards us and he understood and told me a way to help us. I let my section leader know today that I spoke with our band director (which he says is the best thing to do), but my section leader said that it wasn’t my place to say what happened.

I would like to say that I did let him know that how we worded things may seem like we were being rude or anything like that and that it isn’t our intention to make her feel bad.

"This is not the first time he's done this, or something along these lines. He will ""hide"" what he's doing, not tell me about his plans (even if he's already made some with me, and is cancelling), or not mention anything until the next time I see him.
An example of each:
1. He told me he couldn't make out plans because he was going out to the pub. I called him out for this, and he said he was actually working, which is why he couldn't make it.
2. He organised to go out with his friends for breakfast when he'd already planned to go with me. I only found out about this because they called him to find out the times, he never would have told me he's cancelling on me. This has happened quite often, but we had a conversation so l don't think it will happen again.
3. He told me he'd keep two days free to help me move in (i'm moving into his old flat, so he needed to sign documents etc) but went to get a tattoo instead, and tried to hide it from me. I've beer living in awful conditions, I hadn't been able to eat, sleep or shower because of my roommates, and he was completely aware of this as he has stayed with me on multiple occasions. I can provide other examples if needed.

Anyway, we call most nights, and l've had a rough couple of weeks. Two days ago I brought up how I can't come to him with my issues and he told me he wants to change that. Last night, I went out with some friends and had a bad experience, messaged him that I was upset and frustrated, and he got back to me this afternoon. Last week, he told me he was working till 11 tonight, but today he messaged me that he'll be 'out until late' so can't call until tomorrow afternoon we normally call between 11.30-1am).
Admittedly, I did respond saying ""I thought you were working tonight, lol"" which is confrontational.
I know this is small, but it's all building up in my head and making me feel so insecure. It feels like he's always trying to hide things from me, and I feel crazy for asking for the information. I have told him that this slight secrecy makes me think he does trust me, and is also breaking my trust in him, yet he's still doing it.

An example of each:
1. He told me he couldn&amp;#39;t make out plans because he was going out to the pub. I called him out for this, and he said he was actually working, which is why he couldn&amp;#39;t make it.

"I’ve (33m) dated my wonderful gf (32f) for a year now and things have been great. I am deeply in love and she feels the same way, and we’ve started talking about a life together. 

As we got closer, my gf shared that she is guilty for how she treated some of her past relationships, basically a long string of guys that she led on or was selfish towards. I learned: she dumped an ex when he went through a health crisis because she didn’t care enough to stay through it, she made a past long distance ex always travel to see her because she didn’t like the city he lived in and didn’t want the hassle of travel; she told a few exes she started questioning her relationship with them and then strung them along for a few weeks until she finally broke up with them. She mentioned these things because sometimes she worries she doesn’t love anybody deeply the way that others do, and feels shame about that. 

Now, I wasn’t a perfect boyfriend to all my exes either, but I’m a little worried about why she told me all this (was it a warning?) and whether I’m stupidly assuming I won’t be the next one she treats poorly? Things are great now, and I’m glad she reflected on past behavior, but now I feel confused. Would I be an idiot to keep dating her? Expect I would be treated differently?

 I had a really bad depressive episode around 1 year ago and the anxiety got so bad that I couldn’t leave the house unaccompanied. I started counselling in November and I can do things on my own like go to the gym and stuff without anyone and leave the house. Which is massive progress saying the least. 

My mum has been supportive and was happy when I started going out alone but she said she feels sad she can’t come with me but I do have to learn at some point. I distanced myself from old friends because they were fake and my anxiety kind of took over. I with my own courage and help of therapy got in touch with a friend and even met up with her which is again great progress as I haven’t socialised in a year. My therapist said that’s a big step and I was brave and my mum was so happy too. This was last week

However she was talking about a famous person who was independent and did most things alone (and she said like you), and then her mum forced her to do things and she values friends because they gave her confidence and advice and she has a social life now. It’s kinda tiring to hear because I already crave friends and then my mum said you don’t talk to anyone. She later explained that I talk to people and stop shortly and I shouldn’t repeat that. But for me it seemed that she’s dismissing my efforts and showing concern for my social life giving me more panic, and it felt like she’s saying whatever I’ve done isn’t enough.

" 

I (24F) am the oldest child in my family. I have three younger siblings. My closest sibling in age ""Abe"" (22M) and I have been estranged for about 3-4 years. Growing up in our household was equivalent to living in a minefield. Abe would have frequent violent and explosive outbursts for trivial things to my parents at least once a week. In these outbursts there would be a lot of horrible things said about/at my parents, myself, and our other siblings. Often there was violence. Abe frequently stole from people including members of his own family. He also had a fascination for weapons and my parents would often find weapons in his possession and take them away. When I was younger, I used to fear that he would kill us in our sleep. As far as I know, Abe has been diagnosed with ADHD and Depression, but in my opinion Abe has other mental health issues that have never been properly diagnosed. He has been institutionalized once and was in therapy for most of his teenage years.

Eventually I went to college, and did not really speak with him or interact with him. From what I heard back home, the outbursts did calm down when Abe was 17-19, but they did happen every now and then. Abe moved out abruptly in 2020, joined the military, and cut contact with the family. In 2021 he reached back out and was cordial with my parents. He made a few bad decisions during that time that did not help my opinion of him. He was deployed in 2022 and came back in 2023. He moved onto my parent's property in November. I saw him at thanksgiving but did not speak to him.

My Fiancé and I got engaged a few months ago. Even before we were engaged, I expressed to my fiancé and members of my extended family that I did not want my brother at my wedding. A month after our engagement at a dinner with me, my mother, and my youngest brother (Not Abe), my mother surprised me by asking about the ""Elephant in the Room"" by which she meant Abe. She expressed that she didn't understand why I did not speak to Abe and that he ""didn't do anything to me"" so I should forgive him and invite him to my wedding. I was surprised by this and upset that she said that. I couldn't really say much because I was so shocked and told her I would think about it. My parents are well aware of my feelings toward Abe and know that he makes me uncomfortable and has caused me anxiety since I was a teenager. My family has been working on their relationship with Abe and it seems to be going well. I am happy for my parent's to have their son back, but I frankly have no interest in him rejoining my life after how stressful my growing up was with him. My other siblings have been warming up to having him around, which I am neutral about. Maybe because I was older and still remember most of our childhood, I have no interest in being friends or friendly with him?

"I (37M) am a safari filmmaker. As you all know, the Great Depression has been a huge blow to the film industry, so it's no surprise my investors refused to fund my search for a legendary lost island in the Indian Ocean. Nonetheless, I took their money, and after eight weeks we finally landed on the island.

Despite losing dozens of men to native cannibals, dinosaurs, giant bugs and the main subject of my situation, as well as my camera, I managed to save my project by having a giant ape and a dinosaur captured and brought back to New York City. The only reason I managed to do this was because my lead actor's girlfriend was taken by the giant ape as a native sacrifice and he insisted on taking our men into the dangerous prehistoric jungle in order to rescue her. So I blame him and her for all the deaths.

Anyway, to keep the giant ape and dinosaur from fighting each other we had to display them at separate shows. The ape was in chains at a theater and the dinosaur was in a circus cage in Central Park. Unfortunately, both escaped. After killing numerous people each, the monsters fought on the streets. The ape won, climbed the Empire State Building with my leading lady, and was shot down by planes (technically it was beauty that killed the beast).

Both the dinosaur and ape's remains are currently in the AMNH, but now everyone fucking hates me and I'm being sued for millions, as well as facing actual criminal charges. Am I somehow the buttface for sharing my amazing discovery with the world? I need to get back to that island before it sinks.

OOC: If I were to remake King Kong, I'd have more Skull Island fauna brought back to New York City and have the final *T. rex*/*V. rex* fight be there instead of on the island, hence the deviation here.

Each couple has two kids, each close in age to one of the other couple's. Then there's me- I am 11+ years older than each of the other four kids. My siblings, and Jill &amp; Marco's kids grew up together, and my parents became best-parent-friends with Jill &amp; Marco. I knew Jill &amp; Marco well growing up, but as an awkward, quiet teenager, I spent dinners and get-togethers, left to read a book in the corner, or otherwise sit quietly at the adult table. I baby sat all of the kids collectively many times... for free, but not the issue.

Now all the younger kids are in their 20's. Jill &amp; Marco's oldest kid, Taylor, is getting married, and sent my parents a very ambiguous invitation addressed to ""The LastName Family"", and doesn't have the number of seats listed. My parents sent a photo of it to the group chat, and my family chatted about their +1s, and the date, and other wedding-y issues.

Without thinking, I simply went silent in the family group chat. While my parents have remained close to Jill &amp; Marco, and my siblings are probably social-media friends with their kids, I have only seen Taylor maybe twice in the last 15 years, and I've never met the fiancee. I don't know what either of them do for a living. I've seen Jill &amp; Marco in passing when they were visiting my parents a handful of times. I'm not a part of their lives, nor are any of them a part of mine.

Aside from barely knowing them any more, I am an older-style millennial, and I think weddings are mostly performative, and I just don't like them. I think big weddings with hundreds of people you haven't seen in decades are weird and narcissistic.

A couple weeks later, my parents asked me what I was going to wear to Taylor's wedding. I said that I had no intention of going Taylor's wedding, and I hadn't RSVP'd. When asked why, I cited all of the reasons above- I don't know them, I don't like weddings, and I also don't work a normal 9-to-5, so I'd have to take from my limited vacation requests to attend something that I don't feel an attachment to.

My dad flipped out. He started yelling that it's never okay to turn your back on family, and that if someone thinks enough of you to invite you to an important event, there are no excuses not to go, unless you physically cannot get there. He was saying that ""family is family"", and that if I want to be seen is a ""rude b/tch"" that declines a wedding invitation then that's my choice. My mom says that I'm always the difficult one and want to cause waves. We haven't spoken since.

I've declined wedding invitations from actual closer acquaintances that I see regularly, and would of course go if it was someone important to me. It doesn't seem like a big deal to decline.

Jill, Marco &amp; Taylor are also not related to us, AND the invitation didn't even have my name on it. It didn't even have my last name, since my parents didn't give me theirs.

Am I really the problem for declining?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-21T20:02:46.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 40.

"I (23F) work at a marketing company. Two weeks ago, we had a new hire at our department. I’ll call him John (27M). We haven’t interacted much yet since he’s still training with our manager (43F, I’ll call her Linda).

So last week, my friends and I were eating lunch and they said that they think John has a crush on me. I didn’t really think anything of it since I don’t really know him. I’m also dating someone.

Our building’s parking lot is huge and old. There are areas where it’s really dark, especially at night, since some of the lights were broken. So, for safety purposes, the women in our department have established a “buddy system” where we park close to each other, so that when we walk toward our cars at night, we have someone accompanying us. This could change every day, accounting for leaves, shifts in schedules, etc. For context, we’re all being extra careful because last year, a woman was robbed at gunpoint in a nearby building parking lot, and the suspects have not even been identified.

However, last Monday, my usual buddy (I’ll call her Carmen) called in sick. It was only me, John, and Linda in our shift. Linda was staying late, so I couldn’t walk with her to my car. Then, as I was packing up my things, John approached me and said something like, “Hey, want me to walk with you to your car?” I politely declined, since he was still essentially a stranger to me. I also initially thought he was hitting on me. However, he still insisted, saying that Linda told him about the buddy system and the incident last year. He also said he’d be happy to be my buddy whenever Carmen isn’t around.

I don’t know why, but his insistence kinda triggered me. Again, at this point, John is basically a stranger to me. I told him that I have a boyfriend, that I’m not interested in him, and that he should stop asking me. In fairness to him, he did stop when I told him that.

Then, when I got in yesterday morning, he made another remark, saying “Hey, Carmen’s still out sick. If you feel more comfortable, I’d still be happy to walk you to your car later.”

That’s when I kinda snapped. I told him not to bother me anymore about this. I also told Linda that I feel uncomfortable around John. She asked me why, then I told her what happened. She said maybe John was just genuinely concerned for me, but nonetheless, she said she’ll talk to him. Linda also told me that if I want to, I can talk to HR about this since it’s our company’s policy (since he’s still on probation), so I did.

Later on, our HR talked to me, telling me that they’ll give John a warning on his probationary file due to my complaint.

I felt bad for him, but I thought I just did my part given that I felt harassed by him. However, when I told this to the guy I’m dating, he told me I might have overreacted and was an asshole for reporting John to HR when he was just being nice and maybe trying to fit in.

So, AITB for reporting a guy who harassed me at the workplace?

EDIT:

Additional context: I originally didn't have any plans of reporting John to HR. However, Linda told me that it was company policy since John is still a probationary employee. In our company, all probationary employees are technically still under HR's roster. They are trained in their respective departments, but they still technically report to HR. Only when they are regularized and tenured do they formally get endorsed to their respective departments (in this case, when John passes the probationary period, he will then be officially a part of Linda's team).

That was why every matter involving the probationary employees, whether exemplary or not, should be taken up to HR. What they will do with the information is entirely up to them. When I reported the incident to them, it was mostly due to Linda's direction to me. As you can tell from my age, I'm also new to this company (I've just been working here for 8 months, and I was regularized just 3 months ago).","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-21T16:05:06.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (23F) work at a marketing company.

"So I have an only child. I like to take her on at least one vacation a year but I feel bad that she is the only kid. She has a cousin that is her age and I'm okay paying for one extra kid. But the cousin has an older sister. And it's not really fair to bring one sister and not the other.

A few months ago I asked my nieces' mother if she would be interested on joining us on a cruise over summer break. I said I wanted to take my daughter and it would be nice if she had her cousins come along. SIL(well technically exSIL but don't think that matters) was on board and excited. Last week I started to actually do research in booking and apparently I should have done this a while ago because cabins for more than two people during the summer months are filling up fast. I reached out to my SIL with some options and also pointed out an excursion I would like to do. Unfortunately, my SIL told me she had some unexpected expenses come up and she couldn't afford it anymore.

This is where, thinking back, I probably got pushy. I looked into how much it would be to add the nieces to my cruise. Just adding one wasn't much more at all, but adding two was a big difference. One of the nieces is the same age as my daughter, but the older sister is a teenager. I don't mean to exclude her, but she would be kinda the odd one out. She can't go with the kids in the kid activities and kid zone...so she could either hang out with the grown ups or would be in the teen zone without anyone she knows. So anyway, with all this in mind plus the extra cost, I'd ask SIL if it was okay for me to just bring the younger girl and I'd cover her cost.

Understandably, SIL didn't want to leave out the older daughter but instead of saying no, she asked how much more it would be if I brought both of them. I told her the number and said it didn't include excursions or drink packages. SIL said she'd pay for her girls if I brought them both. So I booked it.

Today I discussed with her if she wanted to pay for her girls to have a soda package or not and also brought up the excursion I wanted to do. I told her how much it would be if I brought the girls along, or they can always be left in the supervised kid/teen area on the ship while we go. When she saw the price she said that was more than she was expecting to pay but she will make it work. I told her we still have time and if she can't afford it, I'll see how I'm doing financially closer to sail day and maybe I can pay for the girls to join us on the excursion.

I feel bad now, looking back I feel like I probably pushed her to send the girls on a vacation because I was just trying to make it better for my daughter. And although I mentioned the excursion to her, I never actually gave her a price. I know the girls would be safe on the ship but I guess that is kinda mean to just leave them behind. So I probably made my SIL feel obligated to pay for an excursion that she couldn't afford. AITB?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I left this info out because I was trying not to give too many details but I think it is necessary. I originally told my SIL how much extra it would be to have a room for 5(including her girls) instead of a room for 3(Me, my BF, and daughter). She agreed to pay the extra cost. When I booked, I knew how much SIL was contributing. But I ultimately ended up upgrading to two rooms. I never told SIL this, as I don't want her to feel obligated to pay more than the initial price I told her. I am paying 75% of the room that the three girls are sharing. If I didn't upgrade, I would have been able to afford the excursions. That was my mess up. I assumed either SIL could pay or the girls could do other activities on the ship.

"I (20f) tried a dating app for the first time a few weeks ago. 

I was talking to a guy, A (22m), for around a week. We talked in the dating app chat for a bit and he seemed nice. We had some interests in common. We then moved to Instagram. He asked me out a week ago and I said yes. He ended up cancelling because he was sick. Here on Instagram I saw his profile and posts and there were some red flags for me.

Around the same time I talked with another guy and we went out. We really connected and have been going out and texting a lot since. For this exact reason I realised it was best to tell A I'm not pursuing a romantic relationship with him because he kept asking me out and seemed interested. 

I did this because I really thought he is nice and didn't want him to be disappointed. I said we could still go out as friends in the nicest way I could. 

To my surprise after I texted him, A seemed very pissed off. He said we didn't know each other well enough for me to decide this and that I made him ""uncomfortable"". I didn't know what to say so I didn't answer right away. He then said it's best if we don't go out at all.

I then said I was sorry he thought like this, but that I didn't owe him a relationship. He was pissed and said he ""judges"" my decision and doesn't like people with this ""mentality"", that judge people by superficial things. 

I said I didn't judge him on superficial things, but that I could see I just wanted to be friends. He then said he liked to talk to me and hopes I find ""what I want, bye"". 

This is when I really think I might have been on the wrong. I was kinda of annoyed by his words and said ""I also liked to talk to you, good luck finding a girlfriend ;)"". Because obviously that's what he wanted. He then said he wasn't looking for one and said he was happy I liked the conversation. 

I showed my sister the texts but she thinks I didn't even need to say everything I did.

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a guy, A (22m), for around a week. We talked in the dating app chat for a bit and he seemed nice. We had some interests in common. We then moved to Instagram. He asked me out a week ago and I said yes. He ended up cancelling because he was sick. Here on Instagram I saw his profile and posts and there were some red flags for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time I talked with another guy and we went out. We really connected and have been going out and texting a lot since. For this exact reason I realised it was best to tell A I&amp;#39;m not pursuing a romantic relationship with him because he kept asking me out and seemed interested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did this because I really thought he is nice and didn&amp;#39;t want him to be disappointed. I said we could still go out as friends in the nicest way I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise after I texted him, A seemed very pissed off. He said we didn&amp;#39;t know each other well enough for me to decide this and that I made him &amp;quot;uncomfortable&amp;quot;. I didn&amp;#39;t know what to say so I didn&amp;#39;t answer right away. He then said it&amp;#39;s best if we don&amp;#39;t go out at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then said I was sorry he thought like this, but that I didn&amp;#39;t owe him a relationship. He was pissed and said he &amp;quot;judges&amp;quot; my decision and doesn&amp;#39;t like people with this &amp;quot;mentality&amp;quot;, that judge people by superficial things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said I didn&amp;#39;t judge him on superficial things, but that I could see I just wanted to be friends. He then said he liked to talk to me and hopes I find &amp;quot;what I want, bye&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when I really think I might have been on the wrong. I was kinda of annoyed by his words and said &amp;quot;I also liked to talk to you, good luck finding a girlfriend ;)&amp;quot;. Because obviously that&amp;#39;s what he wanted. He then said he wasn&amp;#39;t looking for one and said he was happy I liked the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed my sister the texts but she thinks I didn&amp;#39;t even need to say everything I did.&lt;/p&gt;

"I am at university currently and I am actively using dating apps. I'm not looking for anything serious which I make clear from the start and just want to date really. There was one person I went on a date with a month ago.

The date was going well, we went for drinks and then when she goes to the toilet her friend comes over and tells me not to hurt her and that I better treat her right etc. I told her friend it was a first date and I found it weird she was sat watching us tbh.

After drinks the girl suggests I go back to hers but at this point she has been really intense and talking about relationships and things so I tell her I've had a good time but that I think we're looking for different things.

Last weekend I was on a date with someone else and the date was gonig great. Then the other girl walks in and once my date goes to the toilet she comes over asking what was so wrong with her and that I clearly was just using her etc and don't actually like her. I politely ask her to leave me alone and she just keeps gonig on so I ask the bar staff to get security and say she;s harassing me so security make her leave.

I was telling a friend the story and he said that I could have been nicer to her and that getting her kicked out was a bit far but I don't see how it was when she wouldn't leave me alone.

"I collect dinosaur and reptile fossils. In addition to adding to my personal collection, I also like to buy common, cheap fossils in bulk such as mosasaur teeth, megalodon tooth fragments and dinosaur bone chunks and give them away locally to kids. 

In November, I reserved a partial megalodon tooth and a Lance Formation dinosaur bone fragment for a woman on Facebook who wanted them for her daughter. She took weeks to organize any pickup times, then she made numerous pickup times but cancelled at the last minute every time. I gave her an ultimatum and she has not replied since the end of December despite me asking her if she could confirm a pickup time.

Would I be the asshole for canceling her reservation and giving the fossils to someone else? Because I feel like she's been wasting my time (I literally give these specimens away for free), but I also don't want her daughter (assuming she exists) to miss out.

After 5 or 6 dates over a few weeks, she starts talking about deleting Tinder. She said since we get on well she wants to be exclusive with me. I apologise but remind her that I'm not looking for a relationship and that I am still gonig on dates with other people. She sayd we could always give it a go but I again apologise and refuse. 

She says I've clearly been leading her on sicne we've been going on actual dates together and that you don't go on days out with people you'er not seeing etc. I just remind her that she knows I don't want a relationship and if she wasn't okay with that then she should have said from the start.

"So I (28F) work from home, and I just started a new job. The past few months have been a whirlwind: I was laid off on my birthday and spent December applying and interviewing. I thankfully got a much better job that I just started in January, so I am only 3 weeks in. It's a lot of work so far and I am in meetings or training all day, so I have very little downtime. To be clear, there was never a gap when I wasn't working - I went back-to-back from one job to the other.

My bf (32M) commutes every day. But since I started my new role, so far he has hardly worked one full week. One time he overslept and was late twice in the same week. Another week he called in sick two days in a row. He wasn't actually sick, he just wanted to take time off because he could. In the other weeks, he has already taken a couple of vacation days. And today he called in sick again because he was tired, even though yesterday was a holiday.

His boss is his cousin, so I feel like he isn't as afraid of consequences. He says that it's his work's policy that if you call in sick for 2 consecutive days, it only counts as one day. So I'm dreading that this means he'll be calling in tomorrow as well. 

I've been thinking about it, and this sums up why it bothers me:

1. I know it's his home too, but I have to admit that it does bother me that he's always at home. I look forward to my work days when I have our tiny apartment to myself and can concentrate and be productive. And now he'll be cooking bacon and playing video games five feet away from my desk when I'm in a meeting with my boss this afternoon.  
2. I desperately need some space. It feels like we're always together and it's grating on my nerves. We just spent the whole long weekend together! He never leaves the apartment except to go to work. So now to keep my peace of mind, I'll have to leave after work to be alone.
3. It feels like he is very unmotivated. He uses his days off to sleep all day. And it's not like he doesn't get enough sleep. He regularly gets 8 hours a night, and on weekends he is always sleeping till 1pm. Tiptoeing around someone who is always asleep is not fun.

I don't know if this is fair to feel so annoyed. AITBF?

Liz and I are pretty different, we value different things politically, religiously, and personally. She has an amazing relationship with her family I didnt. she loves god, i dont (atheist w religious baggage). we do have some things in common though, love for certain TV shows and speaking up for our values. we would have many tiffs over things like abortion, gun rights, and other heavy topics. 

she also had a tendency to make many small jokes that are harmless on their own but build up. like pointing out any minor mistake i made, my reading disability, pointing out physical insecurities and things like that. she also self proclaimed to be the “main character” while we were her supporting cast. she would police our outfits for queerbating, despite us all being queer just not out. the only larger thing Liz did was tell our friend group that we caused her to be sewerslidle and call the hotline due to not inviting her to hang out with us that week which we did upon her request bc of her work load. she never did anything big but everytime i finished hanging out with her i felt insignificant, and stupid, which was starting to ware me out. 

fast forward: we were all chilling at my dorm which i shared with 2 of the members in our circle. i cant remember what made this come up but Liz started joking about me secretly being a furry, having fursonas, and being attracted to furries. in the past she pushed that joke way too far and tried to say i was attracted to animals which is just disgusting. i dont want this to happen again so i continuously told her to stop but she kept on joking. i was having a bad day bc my dog died and said to the group “i can’t do this right now.” and left to my room

a bit later i get a text from her apologizing for the joke and i replied saying needed some time. we had a group dinner planned which i didn’t want to go to due to my dog being put down that morning. she complimented me and i brushed her off bc i was still upset. i didn’t initiate any conversation with her which made her upset. 

the next day Liz asked mutuals to ask me to meet up and talk and i told her again i needed time. they asked on her behalf again and i ended up sending a text formulating my thoughts and feelings. i described how i felt a bit incompatible, and that many of her behaviors hurt me and me not communicating better has caused me to hit a breaking point, which is my fault. i ended up asking for a break and saying i need time to fix my insecurities because i know she didn’t intend to impact me that way. she replied very upset and through the grape vine i heard her telling a bunch of people i was a sociopathic narcissist due to my response","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-20T04:49:27.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend Liz (fake name 21f) and I (21f) have been friends for almost 2 years. we met through a mutual friend, let’s call her  Sam, who acted as the glue for our friendship. we only originally would hang out because of Sam.

Initially she was defensive and withholding most of what took place, I kept at it and eventually discovered much more, including that the two had even discussed and corroborated their stories after deciding to end it, limiting it to one brief drunken kiss in a bar with some texting and emotional connection. In reality it was an ongoing physical &amp; emotional affair spanning multiple weeks &amp; cities.

My wife claims she intended to tell me, while the reason it came out is because I'd been suspicious &amp; discovered their secret chats, confronting her first. There's no way of knowing how it would have gone otherwise. When I confronted her, she gaslit me, scapegoated me, lied and performed all the manipulative-tactics and mental-gymnastics. I understand she was hurting and scared, eventually she did come ""clean"" about more after about 36 hours of my persistence.

I spoke with the male; a mutual coworker with whom we have long history, his wife included. He attempted to assess my knowledge of the situation and censored his story even more-so than my wife, leaving out all physical. I said to him ""I hope you do right by your wife"" to which he replied arrogantly that: ""I may have to answer some questions"".

I hadn't been able to sleep for days, was alone and in crisis. I ended up contacting his wife to talk about it, before he brought it up. Immediately I felt like it was wrong, but it was too late. As I broke the news to her I felt guilty and expressed to his wife that I felt terrible, like I was betraying my wife, how ironic.

Subsequently, I worried I may have put myself and my wife in danger. I texted her and told her what I'd done and that I felt awful. She responded and is very upset, claiming I ""did not give them the opportunity to see if he would be honest"" (while I think that's exactly what I did, because she knows the truth and plans to wait to see what he says), and overall my wife is defending him and using this against me. My wife says it could've been discussed, which I don't disagree with, however I did bring it up to her multiple times prior, and she insisted I do not tell to ""protect our reputation.""

Now I'm the bad-guy. She's concerned his wife will blame her and want to see her suffer, and that she'll ""spread shit about"" her, and in her words ""not that I care"". But I do. To his wife I communicated that I'd be committed to keeping this between the four of us, and that I intend to try to work things out with my wife through counseling. I am so broken right now I can't think straight and feel like I have no one to talk because I am trying to protect my wife's reputation and that of our marriage.

"Hello reddit, this is a throw away.

I (20 F) work at a flight school. I have multiple clients and a very busy schedule. I have recently had a client, who I knew had trouble in the past with other instructors, book me. She has cancelled multiple times for being ""sick."" I heard from other instructors that she cancels last minute and it's always for being sick so she can use the excuse to not be charged. There is never any warning until the morning of, which is fine because sometimes we don't know that we're going to wake up sick, right?

Last week she cancelled on me about two hours before our block, well into the afternoon and even cancelled a different flight earlier that morning at about 8am. This was the fourth cancellation in the past two weeks and all for the same excuse. I saw that she flew the night before but was still claiming that she was sick.

Policy says that instructors can charge their clients if they cancel within 12 hours for up to the block-time because it takes away other peoples opportunity to fly and took away my own income (which I live off of). I decided to charge the whole block time she booked me and the airplane, which was 3 hours, totalling around $200. I understand this is a lot of money, but I live off of it and late cancellations are not okay in my book unless they are for a legitimate excuse. I talked to her previous instructors and all of them said that this was a pattern and to charge her. Other people working there also said to charge her. However, I feel bad charging because that is a lot of money, but I did anyway as per their guidance.

"I attended a wedding locally this weekend, solo.

"Years ago, when a relative ""Arianna (30F)"" was 13 and I was 11, she got into anime and showed me some of it. I wasn't *super* into it but I enjoyed the comedies the most and liked some of the music. It was fun, we'd watch some silly comedy anime with very out there humor and reference it to each other. We also spent a lot of time playing video games and playing in game websites with each other. We shared our interests and had a lot in common. **The only thing I liked that Arianna wasn't into were sandbox games and anything to do with coding.**

Then suddenly Arianna accuses me of copying her for also liking anime. She threw lots of annoying whiny fits when random people in public wore anime shirts as that was copying her. While I didn't watch the anime anymore, I was interested in like 5 songs that she wouldn't tell me the names of as that was copying her, but she'd constantly ask about songs from games I got into first as she wanted to remix them or learn it on piano. I wasn't a dickhead and I told her the song names, but the other way around couldn't be done as that was copying.

Then, being a Nintendo fan was copying her as Nintendo is a Japanese company. Playing Smash (Brawl was current) was copying her as Marth spoke Japanese. Watching the Pokémon TV show was copying her as it's technically anime. Being an Ace Attorney fan was copying her as it's a Japanese game series. Watching YouTube on my laptop was copying her as she watches anime on her laptop. Reading Nintendo fanfics was copying her as there's Anime Fanfiction on fanfiction (dot) net. Getting stuck on a tricky part of a game was copying her because *she* also got stuck there, but if she found the solution before me then progressing any further in the game was copying her. Of course, if it were the other way around I'd be obligated to tell her the solution.

Being annoyed and offended, I proceeded to copy her in the store by picking up the same product as her and ask her ""do you realize how ridiculous that would be?"" then got the product I actually wanted, but she saw that as actually copying. 

A few years later I dealt with a stalker creep in school who actually copied everything I did at all costs. The creep wore the same few clothes every day as they were the closest things she had to mine, and they weren't anything particularly fun. The creep also hated me, but never treated anyone else negatively so I looked crazy. The creep also deliberately waited for me to come out the bathroom stall and ran towards me, away from the sink and door. The creep made me fear for my safety and no one at school took me seriously.

Arianna found this so funny and every day she'd say ""sucks when people copy"" as if I was being that creep by just having stuff in common.

"I've been with my partner for around 4 years. When we first got together we said we both want one child and that we would start thinking about having kids when my girlfriend is around 30 and I'm around 34. 

My view on this hasn't changed but last weekend my girlfriend sat me down and asked if we could talk. She said the more she thinks about it the less she wants to have a kid. I asked what had brought this on and she just said our lives would change too much. She want to still have nice trips without worrying about looking after kids and things like that.

I mentioned that wed still be able to go on holiday and have our parents look after the child occasionally but she said that's not enough. I asked if she was sure and she said she was. She said our lives will be a lot better without kids. I mentioned that my views have not changed and that I still do want to be a dad someday. 

She asked what this meant for us and I just said if she was certain about not having kids then I'm not sure we're compatible anymore. She said I was trying to pressure her to change her mind and putting kids before her. I said that's not what I was doing and that I was pointing out that we want completely different things in the future.

Incident details: To facilitate BIL’s visit, MIL kept his dog overnight. Despite precautions to separate the dogs, a door mistakenly left open led to BIL’s dog attacking ours without warning. The attack was vicious and unprovoked, resulting in our dog losing a small part of its eyelid and sustaining a tear in the eyeball, necessitating emergency veterinary care. The severity of the attack left our dog in pain and traumatized, highlighting the ongoing danger posed by BIL’s dog's unchecked aggression.

My reaction: The repeat of such an intense attack, coupled with the lack of substantial preventive measures, provoked a strong response from me which may have struck a nerve in my MIL. I expressed deep frustration and anger, emphasizing the need for serious behavioral training for BIL’s dog. I warned of the potential legal and life-threatening consequences from other pet owners if such aggression continues unchecked. I definitely said some unnecessary things (cursing, the negligent behavior of training the dog, etc.), but I believe my response was in line with the severity of the issue.

BIL’s response: He took full responsibility and expressed remorse, which I appreciate. However, action needs to be taken so that this does not happen in the future to not only my dog, but any other pet that comes across his dog.

MIL’s reaction: In contrast, MIL’s response focused on my emotional reaction rather than the attack's seriousness. She was upset by my strong words, labeling them as “disgusting” and “inhumane,” and suggested we should downplay the incident as a normal occurrence. Her reaction was more about defending BIL and critiquing my handling of the situation than addressing the real issue of BIL’s dog's dangerous behavior. This has been a pattern, with MIL often dismissing concerns over the dog's aggression and prioritizing family dynamics over safety and accountability.

Question: Considering the repeated, unprovoked aggression from BIL’s dog resulting in serious harm to our pet, and the family’s divided response focusing more on interpersonal reactions than on addressing the root issue, AITBF for my upset and insistence on the need for action?

TLDR: After BIL’s known aggressive dog severely injured ours, I expressed strong frustration and concern for future safety. MIL criticized my emotional response, overlooking the seriousness of BIL’s dog's behavior and the need for training and accountability.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-18T22:51:34.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: BIL’s dog is known for its aggression towards animals, including a previous attack on our dog requiring hospitalization.

"AITB My BFFs boyfriend cheated on her and didn’t tell her. But I knew it.

2 years ago on my birthday I went partying with my best friend. The day after another friend called me to ask if I Laura (my BFF) is at my place and if „he already told her“. I didn’t know what she ment with that. On the phone she told me that Laura’s Boyfriend, Lucas cheated on her last night. She knew that because Lucas called her boyfriend and told him, with all the details. They did not have actual intercourse but he got a blowjob and spend the night with another girl whilst his girlfriend slept at my place. Well here is the thing where I‘m wondering if I am the asshole…
I waited for Lucas to tell Laura. About 1,5 months passed by. Lucas didn’t tell Laura that he cheated on her, although a lot of friends adivised him to tell her. As a bestfriend I felt bad knewing that Laura got cheated on but I did not want to cause any drama or interfere into there relationship, but I really felt bad and sorry for my friend. My at the time kinda boyfriend is a friend of Lucas and I asked him for advice on 
what he would have done and I told him that I actually would really tell Laura because yeah I felt that‘s what you expect from friends, honesty and loyalty, I guess. Well he kinda took that wrong and told Lucas that I want him to tell Lisa. As I noticed that there was this misunderstanding I immediately texted him, that this is not what I want or what I expect him to do. I tried to explain to him how I felt bad for knowing and not telling. She was my bestfriend for 12 years at the time and we spent every day together, we had no secrets but I kept the secret that he cheated on her because I did not want to interfere. Well, Lucas showed up right away at my house and ask Laura to come outside to talk. He told her. He told her that I forced him to do this. Since then we rarely see each other. About once every 6 months. I miss her, I still feel heartbroken. There is a lot more to tell on some occasions afterwards but I really really do want to know what you would have done in this kind of situation. Would you tell her.

"So I (28F) and my friend J (28M) recently got into a disagreement. A couple months ago he was dating this girl R. J and R had been dating for a year at that point. I had never met her as they were long distance and he usually went to her. In October, him and I both got really drunk and made the stupid mistake of making out. It did not go further than that. We both barely remember it. He told her immediately the next day and she forgave him. I know him and I are both TB for that part. I’ve never been so ashamed of myself or him. A couple weeks later, I found out that although he told her, he did not tell her it was me it happened with and kept texting me and maintaining the friendship. I told him that made me uncomfortable especially because he thinks she we have a problem if she knew. I told him either he tells her, they breakup (he was unsure about that relationship already), or I need to step away because I was so uncomfortable. He didn’t want to tell her so I distanced myself. About a week later they ended up breaking up so we resumed our friendship. 

During their time apart him and I got closer and ended up hooking up a couple of times including last week. This week he told me they are likely getting back together this weekend. We talked about if he was going to tell her and he said that’s none of her business if she doesn’t ask and even if she does, she doesn’t need to know it was me and we can still be friends. I clarified with him that if she knew, he thinks she would insist we cut contact. Given the situation, I told him that regardless of if they get back together at this point, I need some space. I communicated many times that I was uncomfortable being friends if his gf was not aware or not okay with it. He argued that it would be cruel to tell her and he and I can maintain a friendship because she wouldn’t know so it wouldn’t hurt her. 

It’s too late for him and I to be friends again at this point. Both of us are tired of having this conversation but am I in the wrong here or overreacting? I have made it very clear from the start that I think it’s a bad idea and that I refuse to continue to disrespect R and their relationship like that. I have done enough disrespecting. He doesn’t have to tell her, I get why he wouldn’t want to but I don’t want to participate in a deception that would lead to problems if it ever came to light. It’s not like people aren’t aware we hooked up. A lot of his friends know. This really sucks because he’s one of my best friends but it is what it is.

" 

Sorry, English is not my first language.

I {14M}, had made friends with this sweet girl {15F}, which who I'll call Kit.  
Kit has been friends with me for six months along with this cool dude as well {14M}, which I'll call him Rain. Also, we'll include another person who we'll call Azure {16F} who is Kit's other friend.  


  
Overall, we all hang out and have fun. We went to an escape room, swam together, and even attended an anime convention. Both of their families are nice, and we've gotten pretty chummy with each other.  
Recently, I've had a sleepover with Kit, with Rain only being able to hang out for us for a select amount of time due to his mother restricting him.   


Which was questionable somewhat, earlier at the sleepover things were calm. All of us were walking around the neighborhood together and laughed lightheartedly. Doing typical fun things.

She has a strange history of lying about things. First, she lied about being from Japan and speaking Japanese. Secondly, she lied to me about knowing Spanish. I have caught her red-handed before since I'm able to speak it rudimentarily. Thirdly, lying about her weight.

This is the biggest one. Kit has lied about having numerous boyfriends, even up to 20 at a time without even telling them. These are just all of the things I've solely encountered; Kit has done and stated weirder things in front of others that I simply do not wish to know.  
Back to the sleepover. When it was around midnight, I and Kit decided to fill out some online quizzes for fun. Both of us were getting tired. While doing the quiz, I had to explain some of the terminology to her. At the end of the quiz, she'd randomly stated being a ""Masofist"". (Masochist.) I corrected her, saying it was Masochist. She blatantly insisted that it was ""Masofist"" instead of masochist. Which was annoying but I decided to not argue over a stupid thing.  


  
Then, I asked how she would define the word. She'd incorrectly define the word and directly say the definition of self-mutilation. I corrected her again and didn't press on it further. Since I didn't want to constantly argue with her since it was just juvenile, and she wouldn't listen to me regardless.

After the sleepover, all of us had a good weekend and I've been looking out for her displaying signs. One day in school, Me and Rain were talking and being silly. If I were honest, Kit is kind of the butt of our jokes. I told Rain about the whole ""Masofist"" thing, and we were goofing off about it. (Note: We weren't posting on social media, blasting it to the whole school, or anything like that)

When we saw Kit, we made the joke around her. And I subtly yelled it out as a smaller joke, hinting that she was into public humiliation. Overall, we just kept joking about it whenever me and Rain saw each other.  
One day, Rain kept yelling ""Kit is a Masofist"" in front of Azure. Then, Kit told Rain that she was considering leaving the friend group since we were outing a personal thing.

"I [24f] cancelled a date planned for tonight and I’m wondering if Im a dick for it. 

For context, we [27m] matched on hinge a couple weeks ago, went on a date last Saturday (2/10).

The date was pretty good! My only complaint was that towards the end he wanted to booty grab/make out every 5 minutes. I don’t mind a little pda but it was a bit much for me.

Despite this, I had a good enough time that we agreed to go on a second date on 2/17.

Now here is some important context. 1.) I’m celibate, and serious about it since was SA’d by my last partner. 2.) I want something casual right now. I can’t see anyone more than once or twice a week because I work full time, im studying for the lsat, and I workout 4-5 times a week. 

A couple days after our first date, I was up front that im celibate, don’t have time for anything super serious, but I do like him and would like to see him again. 

He was generally receptive but a there were some yellow flags:

1. He said he’d be cool with no sex if he knew our dynamic would  eventually lead *somewhere*…not sure how to answer that because I don’t want to promise anything.

2. He said he was looking for his person, that he really likes me, and that he eventually wanted a girlfriend and wasn’t here to play games.

I promised I’d let him know ASAP if I wasn’t interested as not to lead him on. 

As the week progressed, I noticed that our feelings are unbalanced. He showered me in compliments, texted me constantly, responded to every sm story I posted etc., l was responsive but felt a little overwhelmed. All the while our “expectations” convo replayed in my mind.

On Thursday I had a health scare. Nothing serious, but serious enough that I can’t eat red meat or exercise for at least 3 weeks. He’s extremely kind and attentive, but I feel terrible knowing I have to tell him I can’t go on our date. Besides the health reasons, the way he treated me made me realize I’m not in the same headspace as him, and it wouldn’t be fair to have him spend more money on me. 

Yesterday, he asks me if we’re still good for Saturday and I tell him I physically can’t bowl, but that I also think I want something more casual than what he’s looking for. I feel terrible, but I figured he’d have no problem cancelling the reservations with more than 24 hrs notice. His tone towards me understandably shifts.

….What I didn’t realize is that he made reservations at an expensive bowling lounge that required a $220 non refundable deposit— he wanted me to Venmo half. I’ve been bowling locally and NEVER paid that much, but I looked it up l and it’s true. I feel bad he can’t get a refund but I also don’t think I should have to pay him? Had I went out with him he wouldn’t expect me to pay, plus I never asked him to or wanted him to take me somewhere so expensive for our second date.

My friends think I’ve done nothing wrong, but my parents think I should’ve went anyways and that I was disrespectful and lowkey ungrateful. 

I still feel quite conflicted about things….AITB??

EDIT: thanks everyone that’s responded! I don’t really feel guilty about things anymore and it sounds like he was love bombing me.

I also want to clarify, I don’t think celibate describes my relationship with sex and I’ve been using the label wrong. I’m open to having sex again (and I’d like to lol), I’m just vetting out guys that ONLY want me for sex. I’ve been hypersexualized by most of my past partners and SA’d by my most recent ex, so I’m trying to be more cautious.

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, I had a good enough time that we agreed to go on a second date on 2/17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here is some important context. 1.) I’m celibate, and serious about it since was SA’d by my last partner. 2.) I want something casual right now. I can’t see anyone more than once or twice a week because I work full time, im studying for the lsat, and I workout 4-5 times a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple days after our first date, I was up front that im celibate, don’t have time for anything super serious, but I do like him and would like to see him again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was generally receptive but a there were some yellow flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he’d be cool with no sex if he knew our dynamic would  eventually lead &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;…not sure how to answer that because I don’t want to promise anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was looking for his person, that he really likes me, and that he eventually wanted a girlfriend and wasn’t here to play games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promised I’d let him know ASAP if I wasn’t interested as not to lead him on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the week progressed, I noticed that our feelings are unbalanced. He showered me in compliments, texted me constantly, responded to every sm story I posted etc., l was responsive but felt a little overwhelmed. All the while our “expectations” convo replayed in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I had a health scare. Nothing serious, but serious enough that I can’t eat red meat or exercise for at least 3 weeks. He’s extremely kind and attentive, but I feel terrible knowing I have to tell him I can’t go on our date. Besides the health reasons, the way he treated me made me realize I’m not in the same headspace as him, and it wouldn’t be fair to have him spend more money on me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, he asks me if we’re still good for Saturday and I tell him I physically can’t bowl, but that I also think I want something more casual than what he’s looking for. I feel terrible, but I figured he’d have no problem cancelling the reservations with more than 24 hrs notice. His tone towards me understandably shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;….What I didn’t realize is that he made reservations at an expensive bowling lounge that required a $220 non refundable deposit— he wanted me to Venmo half. I’ve been bowling locally and NEVER paid that much, but I looked it up l and it’s true. I feel bad he can’t get a refund but I also don’t think I should have to pay him? Had I went out with him he wouldn’t expect me to pay, plus I never asked him to or wanted him to take me somewhere so expensive for our second date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends think I’ve done nothing wrong, but my parents think I should’ve went anyways and that I was disrespectful and lowkey ungrateful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still feel quite conflicted about things….AITB??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: thanks everyone that’s responded! I don’t really feel guilty about things anymore and it sounds like he was love bombing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to clarify, I don’t think celibate describes my relationship with sex and I’ve been using the label wrong. I’m open to having sex again (and I’d like to lol), I’m just vetting out guys that ONLY want me for sex. I’ve been hypersexualized by most of my past partners and SA’d by my most recent ex, so I’m trying to be more cautious.  Sorry for the confusion!&lt;/p&gt;

hi sorry about my bad grammar at times im kinda high func autistic and suck with making sentences that make sense at times... also sorry if the sentences dont make sense at times i try to put my feelings into words the best i can... so i was curious about if me 19 year old M was the asshole because i cannot tell and one of my friends thinks my dad is just trying to reconcile for his mistakes.

so the story starts off last Sunday during superbowl. my dad has had a history of abusing weed and alcohol a lot and he has gotten blackout drunk on several occasions my mom and brother were currently out of the house and it was just me and him for the time being. i woke up to a call and text from both my mom and brother telling me to ignore my father and do not interact with him due to him being drunk out of his mind. my dad normally takes out his rage on my mom for stupid reasons and since she wasnt there today he decided to take it out on me. I went out into my front room trying to see what i could have to drink from my fridge due to me just waking up at the time and my throat was dry my dad was talking to himself (he has a tendancy to do that when he was drunk) i dont remember what i said exactly but all i remember was that he got hella pissed off at me and started trying to scream at me on how im a disrespectful child and that i dont pay any bills in the house. i try to argue my reasons behind it but hes so drunk i can smell the alcohol on his breath so i kinda gave up trying to talk to him. we had a few back and forths but he tried getting into my face many times and even put his hands on my arms a few times. i was texting my mom all this and she wanted me to get my things together and get ready to leave the house. i didnt wanna leave the house since i felt safe in my room and he couldnt get in and i could just lock my door... yeah turns out he had a key to my room and busted in to yell at me even more. i stole his keys away from him so i can be safe in my room while i packed my things and waited for my mom but he got pissed that i took his keys and started pound on my door to the point where i could see my door go outside of the door frame for just a split second while him yelling on the other side. my friends in a voice call also heard him yelling at me and they even agreed that he was physically abusive and manipulative. my mom and i had to call the cops so i could leave and we could get our stuff safely without him doing anything to us. a bit later we had gotten our stuff in a friends car and was off to my moms friends house for almost a week while he cooled off. when my mom and i arrived at my moms friends house our dad was not happy we left spamming my mom constantly saying that they were done and he was gonna drink nonstop till he dropped himself. my mom was worried about him still despite all that and sent some more cops over for a few wellness checks just to make sure he was alright. story continues in comments.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-18T03:02:41.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi sorry about my bad grammar at times im kinda high func autistic and suck with making sentences that make sense at times... also sorry if the sentences dont make sense at times i try to put my feelings into words the best i can... so i was curious about if me 19 year old M was the asshole because i cannot tell and one of my friends thinks my dad is just trying to reconcile for his mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

"I F22 am receiving silent treatment from friend F23

My friend and I are staying together at a hotel for a convention. We were in costume and she was embarrassed on the way there and back about ppl staring. We went there and had fun and on our way back we took a train. We ate at the station and then were on our way to the platform so we could avoid the peak hour prices. I told her I needed to check a store for an item as we passed it. I went in and she waited outside for me. I was there at most 5 minutes then I came out and she was gone. I looked around and I didn’t see her and I thought that maybe she had just went ahead and was waiting for me on the platform to avoid the peak fee since we both knew where we were going. 
 I went there looked around and still didn’t see her so I began to think that maybe she had gone on the train or was somewhere else in the station so I was thinking I should call her. My phone started ringing so I picked it up and it was her. She asked where I was and I said the platform and I was asking where she had gone as I was looking for her &amp; she sounded pissed &amp; said she was hiding in the Photo Booth because of her costume. She came to the platform &amp; was standoffish towards me. When I tried to talk to her she was angry at me for going on the platform without her. I explained my side that she didn’t tell me she was going to hide anywhere so I came out she was gone and I was trying to find her but she was still mad and told me I should apologize to her. I started to get annoyed as well as from my view l only came there looking for her because she was gone from her previous place without saying anything to me so I tried to find her, being told I should apologize as though it was all my fault seemed unfair. 
 We took the train back in separate seats &amp; in silence and haven’t been talking to each other despite staying in the same room. She seems to think it’s all my fault and I should be apologizing to her. I heard her complaining on the phone about me to her brother, she described the situation as if I had just left her and was going to get on the train &amp; leave her. We are leaving tomorrow and I’m flying back to my country, I don’t know how to handle this situation. It’s not the first fight we’ve had over a small situation. 
 We usually get on well but sometimes i feel like I’m almost walking to eggshells as she gets mad over things that don’t make sense to me. I’m autistic so I understand that sometimes I might be missing things, but sometimes it feels unfair. She said, on the phone, she already told me what to do which is apologize but I don’t think it’s all my fault. Was I in the wrong and I just don’t understand her point or do I have a point?

"I 24m have been dating my boyfriend 25m for about 6 months now. To give a clear image of our relationship; 
I'm extremely inexperienced. My friends call it a purity conplex. I've wanted to stay untouched and clean for my future husband. I heard school time relationships never last so I didn't date at all. I wanted every single first experience to be with my future husband and of course, these being my morals, I wanted my future husband to be the same as myself. 

We met online and he didn't tell me the truth about himself.2 months into our relationship I found out he already had a girlfriend when she found me and told me everything. Apparently he had been married and has kids too. He lied about his bodycount being 3 which was already too much for me, I found out it was way more unforgivable.

 I decided to break up and my friends were split. Half told me he embarrassing looking, earned less than half my salary and the personality isn't much either apparently and the other half told me it was unreasonable to expect someone with no history at our age and someone seeing two people at the beginning of a relationship is common because they're choosing and he had chosen me since he stopped talking to her. + since we had kissed I felt like the type of man I wanted, who matched my morals wouldn't want me anymore anyway and I agreed to go back. I feel like this cost me my mental health as I developed OCD within a few weeks of overthinking about my wasted love life. 

I soon realised that he had no part of life left unexplored with a woman. No matter where we went and what we did, he had done it before with someone. It made me feel dirty like I was being handed used soaking panties to wear. 

He finally found one thing that could feel new and exclusive and it was Minecraft. He said it had always been his dream to play with his girlfriend. I wasn't into it but decided to play with him anyway. I spent hours on it with him feeling like I finally had something that was just ours until last night. I found Facebook posts from when he was in school, a girl posting on his wall about their Minecraft nights and how much she liked him and him posting love heart messages on her wall and it broke me. 

It wasn't jealousy. I just felt every issue build up and reach a breaking point. There was nothing left for me in his person's life anymore.

"When my girlfriend and I got together one of the initial things we discussed were children. We both wanted two children in the future. We said we'd likely look to start a family when my girlfriend is in her early 30s (She was 22 when we discussed this and is 24 now, I am 27 now). 

Since then we've been on a few holidays abroad and there's a long list of places we want to visit and there's a lot I want to experience. Obviously with work and money, we can't really do a lot of it each year. We're managing between 1 and 2 trips abroad each year (we live in the UK).

Recently I've been thinking about everything we said we want to do and experience and to tick everything off the list it will take a long time. Having children will massively hinder that as we'll obviously have a lot less free time and when the children start to get older, our holidays will be more family focused. 

That doesn't seem as appealing to me as it did originally and I'd rather go down the list of places I want to vist and see as much of the world as possible. I told my girlfriend I wanted to talk and she asked what it was about. 

I told her I on longer think I wanted children and told her the reasons mentioned above. She asked if I was sure and I said while I'm not 100% certain, I am still pretty sure. She then asked what it meant for us and I said that obviously I'd love to do everything together but I know she wants children so it might mean it is the end for us. 

She accused me of stringing her along and lying to her from the start about wanting children and trying to pressure her to stay and give up on the idea of having children which isn't true. She just kept repeating that I have been stringing her along and expecting her to give up on wanting children. 

AITB for changing my mind about wanting children?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-17T21:21:55.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my girlfriend and I got together one of the initial things we discussed were children. We both wanted two children in the future. We said we&amp;#39;d likely look to start a family when my girlfriend is in her early 30s (She was 22 when we discussed this and is 24 now, I am 27 now). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then we&amp;#39;ve been on a few holidays abroad and there&amp;#39;s a long list of places we want to visit and there&amp;#39;s a lot I want to experience. Obviously with work and money, we can&amp;#39;t really do a lot of it each year. We&amp;#39;re managing between 1 and 2 trips abroad each year (we live in the UK).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about everything we said we want to do and experience and to tick everything off the list it will take a long time. Having children will massively hinder that as we&amp;#39;ll obviously have a lot less free time and when the children start to get older, our holidays will be more family focused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t seem as appealing to me as it did originally and I&amp;#39;d rather go down the list of places I want to vist and see as much of the world as possible. I told my girlfriend I wanted to talk and she asked what it was about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her I on longer think I wanted children and told her the reasons mentioned above. She asked if I was sure and I said while I&amp;#39;m not 100% certain, I am still pretty sure. She then asked what it meant for us and I said that obviously I&amp;#39;d love to do everything together but I know she wants children so it might mean it is the end for us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She accused me of stringing her along and lying to her from the start about wanting children and trying to pressure her to stay and give up on the idea of having children which isn&amp;#39;t true. She just kept repeating that I have been stringing her along and expecting her to give up on wanting children. &lt;/p&gt;

"So I (M34) and my new girlfriend (F29) have only been dating for about 3 months. Whenever we are together we have an amazing time and feel a genuine connection. The problem is that time accounts for about 5% of our relationship.

I really like this woman and I feel a real connection with her but I also feel like she doesn't value me or my time at all. She's in between jobs and has a really rough relationship with her family. So I started off super understanding to dates being rescheduled because he shit happens, right? But the distance just grows. She continuously breaks our plans because ""She cant handle the depression right now"" or ""my relationship with my mom just has me so fucked up"" or ""work was so stressful I just need the night alone"". Which I understand all of that, but this past month I haven't seen her and we barely talk on the phone. She sleeps until 12pm every day and texts are usually at best 30 minutes delayed but on average 2 hours. She doesn't answer my calls, she says it's anxiety. She says she knows these are issues for her and she know she needs to work on them. She also tells me that she really cares for me and wants me in her life and that she's ""So fucking sorry"" for how awful she's been.

We talked on the phone on Wednesday, Valentines day. Her niece's birthday is on Valentines day (trust me I know what it sounds like but I know this for a fact) So I knew she would have to interact with family and I didn't want to get my hopes up for seeing her. So we agreed to see each other Thursday night at 7:00 and left the phone call happy and excited to see one another. 

Then Thursday comes and we re-confirm the plans and she says ""I'm beyond ready to see you"". Unsurprisingly 7:00 comes and goes. As does 8:00. I try calling and get no answer. Leave multiple texts to see if she's ok, then that I'm hurt this is happening again the day after we talked about it.

So now its Friday and I'm in my office at work, I think I'm going to break up with her. But I don't know if I have the strength And I feel like shit about it because I really like her and I feel like I'm not being understanding of her depression. And I also feel like I'm only feeling this way because I'm being controlling maybe? IDK I'm so confused and upset.

"Hi hi hi!  The people involved are me, a close friend of mine and former lover (S), and my frenemy of sorts (K) who's also a close 'friend' of my close friend.



Whenever I'd do something that K didn't like, he'd bother S about it instead of confronting me.  S would then be upset at me for trying to interact with K and having to explain why I did that, then S would ask me not to do so anymore.  However, S always told me that K did not hate me, though I never believed this.



Yesterday morning, I snapped.  I had enough.  I told S to stop being K's little servant, which resulted in him getting upset and not talking to me.

So then, I switched my focus and tried talking to K about this situation.  He wouldn't respond, so I came up with an idea and I asked a few others to go bother K, just to show him how it feels.  I asked him if he really was chill with me as S told me.  I told K to quit complaining to S, and start talking to me if he had any problems.  Then K finally responded, saying this:



""ok I'm back, I opened DMs for \[S\]'s server since I trust everyone there, I have no intent of hate towards you and I don't want to have to close them again, cut it with these unhealthy thoughts.

One more thing, I \*\*do not\*\* appreciate this behavior that you have been showing to the majority on Discord, you have made multiple people very uncomfortable with your actions and I kindly ask for this to change.



everything above was in a \*\*serious\*\* tone, I aint joking around with this""



I told him that I didn't appreciate him treating S the way that he did, and asked him to stop doing that.  I told him not to do that to S ever again, lest I continue to conspire against him.  After that, K blocked me.



S came back, telling me he didn't wanna be in love anymore, for irrelevant reasons.  I'm not that upset though, since I'm also very bad at love.  He's very compassionate, and I also make music for him, so he allowed me to continue being a friend.

Then, he said he's upset at me for conspiring, even though he also admitted that he really didn't enjoy getting all of K's complaints.  And that K is still his friend.



Also they're both diagnosed with autism.  Not trying to sound like an actual bitch, but I've seen a lot of people with the condition behave in uncanny ways.  As for me I'm diagnosed with ADD among other things.



But yeah.  I'm now confused. If S doesn't enjoy this, why wouldn't he stand up to K?  Is he scared?  Does he think it's normal for a friend to treat you like this?  And AITB or not?



So yeah, I want multiple perspectives on this issue.

"Around a year ago i dated this girl who lived in another state - so yes it was long distance, but we would see each other often on trips and whatnot. We dated for a few months then eventually broke up because we both agreed that we didn’t want a lot distance relationship. After we broke up, we continued to remain friends and talked daily. 

Then my best friend comes in. I had been friends with him for 2 and a half years at that point, and we would go do stuff together all the time. One day when we were hanging out, he mentioned that he found my ex on snapchat and added her. I really didn’t think much of it at the time considering that we had already broken up.

A few months go by at this point with nothing abnormal happening, when all of a sudden about 2 months ago he started kinda dodging me. I’d ask to hang out and half of the times he’d have some excuse that he had something else to do. I still didn’t think much of this at the time because he’s pet of a busy family that travels a lot. Then i started to notice that whenever we would hang out, he’d be on his phone half of the time and hide it from me (he never did this before). At the same time as that happening, my ex starts leaving me on delivered and opened for a day or two, also something she’d never done because we still talked about stuff. This goes on for a while before i ask him what up and he just blows me off saying it’s nothing. Keep in mind, they have never met in person at this point.

Then one day, he travels to their state to go on a college visit. Without either of them telling me, he goes to their house and has dinner with their family. The only way i found out about that is because my exs dad texted me asking if i knew that my friend was going over. When i asked them about it both of them completely blew me off like it never happened. To this day, that is the one time they’ve met in person.

" I live with my girlfriend but last weekend I went out on a night out with my best friend. When we meet up I stay at his since he lives in a different town to me. We normally go to a few bars, maybe a club then go for food and go back to his.

Last weekend we ended up seeing some people we went to school with that we hadn't seen in years. We ended up joining them and spending most of the night catching up with them. We then all went to the club together and stayed until closing at 3am and then went for food.

I was messaging my girlfriend every now and then until around 10:30 when she went to bed when she went to bed. The next morning she asked how the night was and I explained that we met up with old friends and ended up staying out until around 4am. She said I shouldn't have stayed out that late and it's weird that I went to a club with the old friends since it was a mixed gender group.

I asked what she thought was wrong about it and she just said it was disrespectful towards her. I asked how it was but she just repeated that it was disrespectful. I said that all I did was hang out and catch up with old friends but she said I should have just had a drink then stuck to it being me and my friend.

I mentioned that I don't see a problem with joining up with friends when on a night out but she just repeated again that I was disrespectful and shouldn't have been out that late with the group of friends.

"I live with my girlfriend and this weekend we had no plans together. My girlfriend is working Saturday and then seeing a friend on the evening. For tonight (Friday) we didn't have anything planned and would just likely find something to watch on tv or play a game on the nintendo switch and have a couple of drinks. 

My best friend who lives in a town nearby messaged asking if I wanted to go out tonight. When I go out with that friend, if we go out where he lives I have to stay over his. I agreed and told my girlfriend what I had planned. She asked if I was going to his and I said yeah. She said she didn't want me to go since we won't be seeing each other much over the weekend she wanted to have a night in together tonight. 

I pointed out we'd still have sunday together and that me seeing my friend isn't different to her seeing her friend tomorrow. She said she doesn't want me staying out and thinks I should cancel. I refuse since I haven't seen my friend in a while and remind her that we have plans together on Sunday.

She again says she wanted a night in with me tonight and that it's not fair for me to decide last minute to be going out with friends. I ask her what's wrong with me accepting plans and she just repeats that I should be spending the night with her.

"My best friend and I have been friends since the age of 10. From around when we were 18 we planned a holiday we wanted to go on when we could afford it. It's something we've mentioned throughout the years. We're now 28 and can actually afford it.

We were looking at doing late spring/early summer for this year and when looking at accommodation we found our best options were either going to be an airbnb or a hostel. The hostel would be a small private room with 2 beds as opposed to a large shared room.

I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and she has knows about the trip we wanted to take. I mentioned to her that we were looking at taking it this year. She asked when we were looking at it for and I told her. She asked if she was coming and I said no it'll just be me and my friend. She got annoyed at this and said she should be coming with me.

I explained that it was a trip we'd planned for the two of us for years. She said I shouldn't be going away without her. She said we're going to be going out drinking etc in another country and it's wrong to do it when she's not invited to join. I mentioned that she's known about the plans for years and hasn't said anything.

She just repeated that she should be coming and that I should tell my friend it's the three of us going. I refused to do that and pointed out we'd still be going away later in the year. She said the trip is somewhere she's always wanted to go and I just said we could still go together but she just said she should be coming and that I shouldn't be looking at hostels to stay in either.

"y friends were having a Single's Valentine's party. My sister was over and she's about their age, so i invited her over. I really thought it'd be a fun experience for her to meet them. I tell her about them all the time and genuinely wanted her to meet them.

We arrive a little early, the owner of the home and her friend are there, we sit in the kitchen together and after the introduction, she barely speaks 2 words to them until they ask about her job. My sister doesn't chime in on any conversation with me and the other 2. They offer her pizza and drinks and she doesn't even take a bottled water they offer.

It was no better when the rest of our group arrived. We went to the den to play some video games, everyone's gathered on the couch/nearby chairs. Except her. The whole time, she's literally on the other side of the room, she doesn't sit with us or even interact. She's instead calling our mom to complain how ""Nobody's talking to her"". I tried my best to introduce her to my friends, they'd say hi and she'd mumble it back. But that's it. We'd have a big conversation as a group and she's halfway across the room and not even engaging. Like she didn't even try to meet them! I tried to ask her to sit with us but she refused and just texted our parents to come get her.

I don't think it'd had been an hour and she was already asking for a lift home. I really did try to introduce her but she just didn't engage.

She was my ride home because i wanted to drink a little bit. Instead, i had to get another ride because she was long gone. I tried to tell her we were about to play some games together and that'd include her but she just didn't care (It's the game we play as an icebreaker to new people, it's a fairly social game). Plus one of our friends is out of town and we included her through video chat and she couldn't even be bothered to step into frame of the webcam to say anything.

She left without saying goodbye, not even to me, i didn't even notice till she was gone and i got a text from my mom that she left and they'd come get me.

My friends asked why she left and i told them she left because nobody talked to her and they said she didn't even try to talk to them either, she just sat there on the other side of the room. They found that and the fact she just vanished to be rude.

But now my family's acting like it's my fault for not ""Introducing her"" and not ""getting them to talk to her"". I tried, i introduced but she didn't really bother and in general we were just bantering about various media and social topics. She's on the phone complaining the whole time. I can't just say ""Hey guys, talk to my sister please"".","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-15T04:51:45.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;y friends were having a Single&amp;#39;s Valentine&amp;#39;s party.

"In my first semester at university, I forged new friendships, hopeful they would be lasting. However, I soon discovered that the friends I made in the first semester might not be the ones who stick around. In the second semester, I found myself forming a trio, which later got to be a group of four.

However, one member of our group, whom we'll call Stephen (20M), began to be suspicious. He started distancing himself from us, opting to spend time with another group from my first semester, despite being aware of the issues I had with them. This raised red flags.

My concerns heightened when I noticed my pictures circulating within their group, accompanied by strange captions. Things took a darker turn when another friend in our group, Andrew (19M), got a hold of his phone. Andrew's eyes caught a mysterious text, he was curious to see what was going on and accidentally opened the group chat. Only to find out that not only mine, but also his and another friend's ( Justin) pictures were shared, and they were making fun of those pictures, with very unreal comments. We decided to cut ties with Stephen.

After things got better (which I believe) Andrew began fabricating elaborate stories for attention. He claimed to have been attacked by Stephen's associates, seeking financial assistance for medical treatment from me and our other friend (Justin 19M) Despite Andrew's increasingly implausible tales, I and another friend, Justin, naively supported him without question.

As Andrew's stories became more outlandish. Confronting Andrew only resulted in deflection and blame-shifting. Many stories came up, like every day a new story, and he knew that I had proof but I don't know why he still chooses to lie. This also makes me wonder the reason that he was taken out of his previous friend's group.

When my sister intervened and demanded clarification from Andrew, he reacted defensively, shifting the blame onto her. Eventually, he returned the money (as my sister asked him to), but his penchant for deception persisted. After the 19th he still came, asked him why, and he said I took the case back, and my cousins also did. (What he filed against them, I don't think he should have taken back, coz it was pretty serious.) And why did they take it back? He never answered those questions.

Now, as I distance myself from Andrew, grappling with feelings of betrayal and uncertainty, tensions rise within the group. Justin accuses me of exacerbating Andrew's mental distress, while Andrew scapegoats my sister for his trouble.

"My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for 5 years. He is a lawyer and i am studying/training to be a psychologist.

I am someone who loves giving and receiving gifts, and my boyfriend is aware of this.

This year for Valentine's Day, I gave my boyfriend a kurta (traditional Indian ethnic wear) that I thought he might like to wear for a local festival that was also incidentally on the 14th of February.

I had spent some time looking for a design that I thought he'd like, and I was very excited to give it to him. On receiving the gift, his response was, ""It's nice, but I have nicer kurtas. His reaction bummed me out somewhat but I shrugged it off then.

My boyfriend's gift to me was a small potted plant and a pack of 4 Ferrero Rochers. The plant was in a small mud-crusted pot with dirt all over it.

Now, i love both plants and chocolates. But I do not usually keep plants at home because i cannot take proper care of them.

So this particular gift felt very impersonal and last minute to me, and I couldn't help feeling disappointed.

In fact, I felt a little insulted because i knew that he could easily afford a more personalized gift, but he simply chose not to. Even the chocolates he gave were the smallest pack available in the market and i usually buy myself bigger boxes of the same.

I know it probably sounds materialistic, and i am grateful for the gifts i received, but i also feel sligh resentful that he thought I'm only worth so much to him.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-15T08:44:25.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for 5 years.

&lt;p&gt;I had spent some time looking for a design that I thought he&amp;#39;d like, and I was very excited to give it to him. On receiving the gift, his response was, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s nice, but I have nicer kurtas. His reaction bummed me out somewhat but I shrugged it off then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend&amp;#39;s gift to me was a small potted plant and a pack of 4 Ferrero Rochers. The plant was in a small mud-crusted pot with dirt all over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, i love both plants and chocolates. But I do not usually keep plants at home because i cannot take proper care of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this particular gift felt very impersonal and last minute to me, and I couldn&amp;#39;t help feeling disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I felt a little insulted because i knew that he could easily afford a more personalized gift, but he simply chose not to. Even the chocolates he gave were the smallest pack available in the market and i usually buy myself bigger boxes of the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it probably sounds materialistic, and i am grateful for the gifts i received, but i also feel sligh resentful that he thought I&amp;#39;m only worth so much to him.&lt;/p&gt;

"On Sunday morning, I noticed a small package sitting on my front porch. Neither my wife or I had ordered anything, so I found this odd, but when I brought it inside, I noticed a small card attached. I discovered that it was a gift from my mother-in-law for Valentine's Day, one dozen chocolate-covered strawberries.

When my wife came into the foyer, I told her what her mom had sent us, and she seemed excited and grateful. I told her that we should refrigerate them right away and eat them over the next few days, but my wife insisted that they would keep until Valentine's Day. She said that it was important to enjoy them after a nice dinner we had planned. I tried protesting, but she insisted that we wait and suggested that I had a lack of willpower. That wasn't the case at all (I rarely eat sweets). I was just concerned that the berries would rot before we had a chance to eat them. 

Fast forward to today, and my wife said that we should eat some of the berries. I pulled the box from the fridge, and there were already some warning signs. The berries were much more pungent than they should have been, and the chocolate was starting to fall off. I bit into one, and I immediately realized that there was a problem. It was way too soft and it didn't taste right. I spat it out into a napkin. Long story short, every single berry had gone bad. My wife's refusal to listen to me had led to her mother's hard-earned money going to waste. My wife started tearing up, as if I hadn't tried to warn her a few days ago that this would happen. 

I asked her why she was crying, and she said that she ""didn't think the fruit would rot so quickly."" I couldn't help but laugh. I reminded her that this is the result she wanted, since she refused to listen to me. She replied with something like ""you had a lucky guess."" This really made me mad. I told her that I couldn't believe a grown woman doesn't understand that fruit rots if you let it sit too long. I told her that I grasped this concept from the time I was a child. She said that I had been ""condescending"" and said that she couldn't believe how poorly she had been treated on Valentine's Day.

She's been sulking for the past 30 minutes, and I'm considering calling her mother to tell her that she had wasted such expensive fruit. I just can't believe that this is somehow my fault, when I was the one who suggested that we eat the fruit in a reasonable timeframe. If anyone should be apologizing, it should be my wife, and I can't even do enough mental gymnastics to figure out how I'm to blame. In my opinion, my wife should apologize to me and my mother-in-law, but she seems to be completely blinded by ego. I just need her to understand that sometimes I know what's best in a given situation and that she shouldn't fight me on everything like a stubborn mule. I'm feeling really defeated.

"I am in “Situationship” with this guy I’ve known for years I’ll refer to him as R. We use to hangout and hookup in Highschool. A few months ago after I had broken up with my long term boyfriend me and R reconnected.

 We hangout, have sleepovers, and hookup. We have not talked about what we are but I was pretty sure it was the same situation as Highschool aka nothing serious and he didn’t want a relationship.

 I slept over last night and when I woke up (valentines day) he said he had something for me and showed me a small gift. I said “you did not get that for me” partly joking I was just surprised and we have a very humorous relationship. He was immediately upset.

I tried to talk to him and hug him bc i did appreciate it but he did not want me to touch him and told me I should leave. 
I left (without the gift) and later texted him my confusion and said I was grateful just surprised and want to talk to him but he has not responded.

" My  girlfriend have been together for just under 3 years now. She has had a  couple of relationships before me. Recently her ex boyfriend sarted  messaging her which she let me know. Anyway at the weekend we went for a  date night that we had planned.

We  had a table booked at a restaurant we both like and then a couple of  cocktail bars booked. The night was going really well until we were at  one of the cocktail bars and her ex walks in. He comes over to say hi to  her and then asks if we want a drink. I say that we're alright thanks  and that we're leaving after the drinks we had anyway.

He  asks again and says it's only a drink and I just repeat what I had  already said. My girlfriend says it can't hurt to have one drink with  him but I remind her it's supposed to be a date night for us, not time  to sit and have drinks with her ex boyfriend. She just says she doesn't  see the problem with 1 drink but I just say I'm leaving after the  current drink and she can either leave with me or stay and dreink with  her ex.

We leave together and she  says she doesn't want to go to the next bar and just wants to go home.  She accused me of ruining the date but I disagree and point out it was  supposed to be our date, not a date with her ex.

She  just repeated that I was wrong for not agreeing to just have one drink  with them but I just said I wasn't going to sit and be a third wheel on a  date with my girlfriend and that it was weird how much she wanted to  have a drink with him.

" For valentines day this year my partner and I said we wouldn't get each other presents and would just go out for a meal instead. We went for a day out of Saturday and my girlfriend saw an expensive box of chocolates that I could tell she really liked. They cost a lot more than we'd usually spend on chocolates.

She joked that she expected them for valentines day. I knew she was joking but could also tell that she liked them. I decided to order the chocolates as a surprise for her for valentines day. They arrived yesterday and I surprised her with them this morning. She looked shocked and then she seemed annoyed. She said I'd wasted too much money getting them and that I shouldn't have got them.

I told her not to worry about the money since it was my money anyway and I wanted to treat her. She just repeated that I shouldn't have got her them and walked away. I asked what her problem was and she just repeated that I shouldn't have gotten her them. I asked why since she clearly liked them and she just said I should have listened.

"Disclaimer: this happened a few years ago, but my friend recently told me she was still upset over the ordeal.


So I (19f) broke up with a girl we’ll call Ida (19f) in June of 2021. We broke up mutually after losing feelings for each other once the college year ended. Since it was an amicable breakup, we decided that after some time apart, we would try to be friends. I also started a full time job at an experience venue around the same time, so I had significantly less time to talk to her than she did I. Her, my best friend and I would call at least every few days to chat and catch up with what has been happening in our lives.

A few months later, I started dating this guy Sam (21m), so I was spending less time chatting with both of them, but she would ask to call nearly every day, and when I would tell her I couldn’t because I was hanging out with Sam, she would insist on calling still. For reference, these calls would be an hour at the absolute minimum. Occasionally, I would agree to have a call although Sam said that it would sometimes make him uncomfortable because Ida would ask questions that were not entirely appropriate. When we would call, the only thing she would talk about — aside from asking inappropriate things about Sam and I’s relationship — was anything and everything Harry Styles. I could rarely ever get a word in.

Don’t get me wrong, I like Harry Styles and his music, but I don’t want to hear about only Harry Styles for an hour and a half straight at least three days a week. She had just started the next year of college, and had a lot on her plate, and I wanted to talk to her as a friend and help her in areas that I could. Anytime I would try and ask how she is doing, she would change the topic to Harry Styles. 

This continued for a few more weeks, and here’s where I might be TB. We’re in another call, and again, it’s all about Harry Styles. The things that I’ve heard a dozen times now. I interrupted her and said “Ida, I don’t care about Harry Styles. The only reason why I accept these calls is to have a conversation and talk to you. All you do is tell me the exact same things about Harry every single time we talk. I can’t get a word in, and I honestly don’t care. I’m friends with you, not Harry.” She got silent and then said that Harry Styles is the only thing that makes her happy. I responded brashly by saying “Ida, he can’t be the only thing we talk about for six hours out of my week.” 

She ended the call and told me that I was being an asshole about her and her interests, I never asked to call her, and I don’t call her enough throughout the week. She blocked, or unadded me everywhere she could’ve (including Duolingo). She told me if I apologized and called her more frequently, we could be friends again.

"When I was at university I lived with a girl, lets call her Emily. Emily is gay and ended up in a relationship with a girl, lets call her, Holly. Emily and Holly ended up being probably my best friends from university and I haven't seen them since we graduated 5 years ago as Holly was from Norway and they both moved there straight after graduation. 

We've recently gotten back in touch and they've invited me to come and stay with them for a week. I've always wanted to visit Norway so I accepted. They said my girlfriend could also come if she wanted and they said we can stay at their place. I mentioned it to my girlfriend and she said that Norway isn't really somewhere she's wanted to go and that it'll be too cold for her. 

I accepted that and told her that I would still be going. She asked if it would affect us going away this year and I said it shouldn't since this holiday will be quite cheap since I'll only be paying for flights. She asked why I wouldn't be paying for a hotel and I reminded her that I'll be staying with Holly and Emily. She said she wasn't comfortable with me staying with 2 women and that it's weird that I am fine wiht it.

Emily is gay and ended up in a relationship with a girl, lets call her, Holly. Emily and Holly ended up being probably my best friends from university and I haven&amp;#39;t seen them since we graduated 5 years ago as Holly was from Norway and they both moved there straight after graduation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve recently gotten back in touch and they&amp;#39;ve invited me to come and stay with them for a week. I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to visit Norway so I accepted. They said my girlfriend could also come if she wanted and they said we can stay at their place. I mentioned it to my girlfriend and she said that Norway isn&amp;#39;t really somewhere she&amp;#39;s wanted to go and that it&amp;#39;ll be too cold for her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accepted that and told her that I would still be going. She asked if it would affect us going away this year and I said it shouldn&amp;#39;t since this holiday will be quite cheap since I&amp;#39;ll only be paying for flights. She asked why I wouldn&amp;#39;t be paying for a hotel and I reminded her that I&amp;#39;ll be staying with Holly and Emily. She said she wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable with me staying with 2 women and that it&amp;#39;s weird that I am fine wiht it. &lt;/p&gt;

" I live with my girlfriend and on a weekend we will clean the full apartment. We both have specific chores that we complete.

I tend to finish first and have asked my girlfriend if she wants any help with hers but she always refused since she likes to do things her way. She was the same when living at home, if her mum did the chores my girlfriend does, she would redo them her way.

I clean the bedroom, office and kitchen and I vacuum the apartment. My girlfriend cleans the bathroom and living room and dusts the apartment. I finished my chores this weekend and then put tv on and started playing a video game.

She walks past the living room and comments “that must be nice”. I asked what she meant and she said it was bullshit that she was still sat cleaning and I was relaxing playing games. I said I can’t help finishing first and that she likes to do her chores her way so what exactly was I supposed to do.

She just repeated that I shouldn’t be sat playing video games while she’s still cleaning.

"My dog is my world. She is amazing and sweet and I care about her more than anything else.

I have recently been promoted and am adjusting to the hours, concerned that my dog would be neglected I asked around for someone to watch her. A (now ex) friend contacted me.

She is older and has two dogs and loves my dog. She said she would do it for free. I said I would bake or pay. She said no. I even slipped money into her purse and she found it and gave it back tied to my dog's collar.

Everytime she watched my dog, I would ask if she wanted payment. She said no. On the third day she sends me a message saying that her neighbor is helping her with the dogs and cannot feed her children, she would like me to pay $100 for the woman to get food. ""It's what Jesus would do."" She tells me and I just leave the money on the counter.

I didn't even bother thinking who this woman is. My dog is apparently spending her entire day with someone who cannot buy her kids food.

But anyway. I let it go. Everyday I get more messages: give me money to take her out to lunch, she is hungry, I don't want her to think I am abusing the friendship.

I recently told her I am uncomfortable with this arrangement because of the begging and lack of transparency. I have tried giving her money and I have offered everytime. She says no. Yesterday she says she's getting over her pride to ask for money and I told her I have been offering but she declines. She vehemently lies and I show the text message which ends up in a phone call that ends up in voicemail that I promptly delete.

I know she's screaming at me.

I contact the neighbor via Facebook and tell her about being a ""charity case"" she said she has enough money to feed her kids and that of the $100 she only received $40. I sent her the screenshots and she said I was overreacting.

There is a screenshot that literally says: ""she has no money to feed her kids, please give me $100 to help.""

"I’m close to both my roommates, but one of them (let’s call her A) is weirdly mean to me. We all lovingly “insult” each other as a banter, but A consistently goes too far and it hurts my feelings.

It started with autism jokes. I was grieving a recent death, and was being a lot “slower” than usual. During this period, A started joking that I was “autistic” any time I messed up or was confused about something. She was super nice most of the time, but then would sometimes randomly decide that everything about me was cringey and autistic, or something. These comments were ALWAYS made in front of our other roommate (let’s call her B), even at really inappropriate times. Once I was talking about my difficulty relating to other girls growing up as a NB person, and A said “It’s not about gender, you’re just autistic.” Maybe I’m being sensitive but that’s MEAN.

There’s nothing wrong with having autism, but I don’t. I DO have severe social anxiety, which A knows, and her comments made me really insecure. The idea that I’m socially inept and can’t even see it is LITERALLY MY BIGGEST FEAR as someone with social anxiety.

After a heart-to-heart, A apologized for the autism comments and stopped making them (but my insecurities have remained). She still makes tons of other mean comments, though. Sometimes it’s about me as a person (implying I’m annoying, weird, etc). Other comments are roommate-specific (loudly calling me out whenever I make a minor mistake, like forgetting to turn the bathroom fan off). She always uses a harsh tone and ALWAYS does it in front of B, which is humiliating.

Everything came to a head yesterday. A made several mean comments the night prior, so I already felt terrible. When A got home, she took a shower, then immediately went into the living room and loudly criticized me for forgetting to take the trash out when I cleaned the bathroom the night before. I had been forced to clean at 1AM, because it was the only time that worked with their shower schedules. I forgot to take the trash out because I was TIRED.

I then went to the bathroom, and saw hair all over the floor and conditioner on the shower walls I JUST cleaned. I snapped, and decided that if A can humiliate me in front of B all the time, it’s okay for me to do the same to her. I sent an admittedly petty text in our roommate groupchat:

“In the future, when we shower, can we all please clean up after ourselves? Disappointing to see hair &amp; conditioner everywhere, when I was up late cleaning it last night.”

When she saw it, she went to my door and lectured me about how I could have just asked her privately, that embarrassing her in front of B was unnecessary, and the text itself was overly “rude.” She was really upset.

From my perspective, I was just doing the same thing to her that she does to me all the time. But based on the conversation we had, she seems genuinely unaware that she was hurting my feelings and humiliating me all this time.

"I don't think I'm doing anything wrong here but my boyfriend thinks I am. In the last 5 years I have lost my father, 2 brothers, a sister and 2 uncles. I am now the only living child my mum has and she has no living siblings so we're close. We live in different cities so don't get to see each other too often, maybe once every 2 months for a day. 

This means I'll call her each day to check in and see how she is since she cannot text. I'll give quick 5 min calls on my way to and from work and when I'm on my own for example if I'm home alone or if I'm walknig ot the shops. My boyfriend knows I do this and it does not interefere with our time together.

He sat me down last night to say he finds it weird how much I talk to my mum and thinks I should heavily cut down. I asked why he thoguht that and he just said it was far too excessive and I shouldn't be talking to her that much. 

I disagreed with him and refused to cut down how much I talk to her. He said I was disregarding his feelings and not listening to him. I just said that listennig to him does not mean doing whatever he asks. I pointed out me talking to my mum does not affect him in the slightest and he just repeated that it was weird and excessive and I should listen to him.

My best friend moved away about a year ago and since she moved she’s been really struggling mentally, she was recently diagnosed with a disorder that requires her to take meds that she cannot drive or work while on. She asked me to move in with her once she got this news and after a lot of consideration I decided it wouldn’t be best for me. In light of this and considering valentines is coming up I was putting together a gift to send to her. Before I sent the gift she had text me multiple times explaining she was upset with me for not responding to her quickly enough. I apologized and explained to her that usually when I don’t respond I’m at work and I always try my best to get back to her asap.

I thought that we had moved past the argument and the next day I asked for her address to send the gift. She very coldly told me she wasn’t interested and that if I wanted to do something nice for her I could respond quickly. I told her again I was sorry and that if she really didn’t want it I’d give it to someone else. So I called another one of our mutual friends and asked if she’d like it. Apparently word got back around to my best friend what the gift I had gotten for her was because later that day she texted me with interest in the gift saying she’d “accept my offer” but only if I replied to her at an acceptable speed. 

I honestly hadn’t been too offended up until this point. I felt as though she was only being reasonable now to get the gift and not because she had an interest in making up with me. I didn’t respond after a day and she threatened to end our friendship all together. At this point the rose colored glasses had been ripped off and I started to reflect on all the similar things that had happened in our friendship before this and I realized I gain nothing from our friendship while she gains everything. I was the only friend and family of hers to visit her not just once but multiple times since she’s moved, I spent a considerable amount of money on these trips and never asked for anything in return, for me just knowing I was helping her mental state was enough. I even visited her within the same month a beloved pet of mine passed and never blamed her for the time that trip took from me. I realized all the times I’d paid her way when she’d never do that same for me. I ended up replying to her letting her know she was right and I had no interest continuing this relationship. While I do feel some relief now I can’t help but feel sad aswell and like maybe I’m making a mistake. We have been friends for 8 years at this point but maybe it’s time to put an end to things.

"I know this sounds bad but let’s start from the beginning it was start of 10th grade my friends we will call them Violet and Nevaeh. So at the end of 9th grade Nevaeh started dating this boy named Carter. The relationship Was going good but they break because Nevaeh moved away. After a month Nevaeh starts dating Carter again. I like Carter durning that time but it was a crush. They broke up again and I found out Cafter liked me. I really liked him and asked Nevaeh if I could date Carter she said yes. But that is not where it ends. So out of nowhere Violet  say “I am dating Carter” I am like what the hell.She knew I liked him i asked if they could break up cause I don’t want boys to get in the way of our friendship. She said no that is weird you like my boyfriend. I was angry but whatever. Then I found out that theater the only reason Cater dated Violet was cause one of  Violet 12 grader friends told him to date Violet he did it for like a week and broke up with her. He wants to date me. What do I do??

So WIBTB if I date my best friends ex bf

Short Update: Yesterday after I posted this I talked to my school counselor and told her everything. Right now I think violet is cause it drama for drama. I also told her what her friend said she was kinda pissed. One of my friends let’s call her Layla. Layla was hanging out with one of her other friends and violet came and said “I don’t know why Macey (my name) was mad at me”. She told me that night and I was pissed because the counselor said she would talk to violet. She also started telling her friends and spreading drama. Most people are on my side. Layla says I should ruin her reputation and stuff like that I don’t know what to do.

I also told her what her friend said she was kinda pissed. One of my friends let’s call her Layla. Layla was hanging out with one of her other friends and violet came and said “I don’t know why Macey (my name) was mad at me”. She told me that night and I was pissed because the counselor said she would talk to violet. She also started telling her friends and spreading drama. Most people are on my side. Layla says I should ruin her reputation and stuff like that I don’t know what to do. Today I have a snow day so I will update again on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a lil different then what is on this subreddit but please bear with me

So me (17)f had been dating my ex bf(17)m for about 4 months, recently, he’s been kind of cold, and I asked him if he was losing feelings, and he finally confessed that he that he had, but it was because of his mental health issues, he has bipolar disorder. I was obviously heartbroken, because I had given him as much as I could but I respected his decision. See my boyfriend is a cosplayer, a small call of duty cosplayer with less than 1000 followers on TikTok and I checked it out on my main account on TikTok, and it said that this user does not exist which is strange because he was really confident in the account so I made a throwaway and I looked up his username for that account and turns out he had blocked my main acc and has been posting on his cosplay acc and flirting in the comment section with girls, and not lightly either, such as calling other girls hot and even making suggestive remarks in his comment section. he is also lying about his age saying he is 18 when he doesn’t turn 18 for another month and a half it has been two days since we broke up and he’s already doing this. I know I sound crazy but I’m really really disappointed and pissed because I gave this man everything I had not to mention he broke up with me a day after I told him, I was having self bye bye thoughts I was having these thoughts because the day before I told him that it was my ex best friends self bye bye anniversary I feel really betrayed. Is he in the wrong?

"I've been dating ""Jane"" for over a year and a half and her mom is in town this weekend.  She drove down yesterday (Friday) and my girlfriend originally said she planned on having all three of us go for ""walks/meals"" together.  

When we were talking yesterday before her mom arrived, she mentioned that her mom is excited to watch the Superbowl (for the commercials) and she (Jane) hoped I would join them.  I told her I was planning to very intentionally not watch the game this year because I really dislike both teams and I don't watch football much anyway.  

She seemed upset about that and said she still wants me to watch it with them, and I told her I would be happy to do other things throughout the day on Saturday or Sunday before the game.  

So Saturday has almost come and gone and they spent a lot of the day at a pedestrian mall about a half mile from my house.  I wasn't invited to participate so I went to my normal morning workout then out to get Valentine's Day gifts for her and some lunch.  When I got back, I let her know I was in town and she said they were still shopping and about to get dinner.  I needed to run an errand nearby and mentioned that, but I wasn't asked to join for dinner or stop by to say hi- which is all fine by me, but it leads me to wonder....

If I decline to go to her house to watch the game tomorrow, WIBTB?  I'll talk to her tonight and let her know that's my plan and offer to go for a walk or a meal tomorrow, but I really don't want to sit around for 3-4 hours watching a game that I wish both teams could lose.  

My concern is she will say I'm a jerk for not taking the opportunity to see her mom, but I think if that was an issue then should have made other plans for the 3 of us where I was included in the planning, which is a recurring issue for us because she often makes plans and then expects me to tag along without considering whether I want to or am even available.

"I (56M) have been trying to survive a fungal zombie pandemic for 20 years now. I lost my daughter (14F) at the start of the pandemic, which has made me kind of bitter to say the least. About a year ago I was tasked with transporting a teenage girl (14F) to a terrorist group in hopes of finding a cure because she's immune to the cordyceps. Long story short, we've been through hell together, I've accepted her as my new daughter, and I got her to a hospital in Salt Lake City only to find out that making a vaccine for the cordyceps would kill her.

So like any good father would do, I killed everyone in the hospital and saved my daughter's life. She woke up in the car on the way back home and asked what happened. This was awkward, so I just made up a little white lie that there's lots of people like her and they've stopped looking for a cure.

Throughout the year I found out that she was being dishonest, lying and hiding about who she has been with in the past. I told her immediately from the start of our relationship that I value and view sex as something that you do with someone who you care and you give them a part of you emotionally and physically so you do it only with people you love. sex is supposed to be special as you become tied with the others spiritually. because of that she told me that’s she been with only 6 people and i told her how she would be my 3rd but only because the first two where forced and i did not want it. no big deal everyone has a past so be it. we moved on from that. throughout the year she kept telling me more and more about the people who she was with and eventually surpassed 6. I confronted her because i don’t know why she would lie. she than made a list and over 20 people are on there (im 21st) had she been honest right away i wouldn’t have cared. but her past and what she’s done with others truly disgusts me. she lied about it and had me meet these people she’s done stuff with without me knowing their past hurts me. on top of that a few months later she was sharing out intimate details to her male  friends that i also later learned she did stuff with and wanted to be with. it broke me. but i loved her and just kept telling myself that her past is the past and to not let it bother me. i went to therapy but my therapist ended up thinking the same way i do and told me to really question why im with her. being young and in love im still with her. she has been poly in her past (not with me) and said in the beginning that if i wanted to sleep with other people i could (im bi). i said no bc im monogamous. i love her and i only want her. she constantly brings up these people she’s done things with and it can even be as small as when earlier today we went to verizon and she was pointing out a phone one of her friends she fucked has and how cool it is when they where around eachother. it’s completely unnecessary information she shares now just gets my mind running about the things they did. when i mention how someone on tv looks nice she goes “you know the rules 😉” meaning that she’s okay with me sleeping with people as long as it’s within her rules she established if i accepted. im tempted to tell her i want to sleep with other people bc i she makes me feel like sex isn’t special to her as to me im giving her my everything and in turn im just getting crumbs to everyone’s left overs bc of that i dont feel special and when i told her she continues to not do anything to make me feel special to her. i feel very unwanted. from the many conversations we had she recently told me that sleeping with other people might help me get over her past.

" Aith for blocking my friend

Me 14f and my friend A15f have been friends since 7th grade (were now in 9th). Our friendship is very.. unstable, to say the least. I am a very calm quiet person, while she is more out going. A has a lot of medical problems (that more than half she made for herself), that I listen to when she needs to vent. I let all my friends vent whenever they need, but they also call to just talk. A never just calls to talk, just complain and complain. Which I couldn’t mind if she wasn’t such a pain to be friends with, she blocks me over the simplest things so let’s start with the first I can’t think of;

Beginning of 8th grade she liked this boy, like really liked him. While she was out of school one day I was texting her that another girl liked the same guy, and she flipped out (swearing at me, saying she didn’t care, etc). She started screaming at me that she was in the hospital (which I didn’t know about) then blocked me.(I ended up crying myself to sleep that night)

About 4 months later she apologized, and we were friends again. After a week she blocked me again because “her bf didn’t like me” 


Now 9th grade year she had moved schools (this is important) and homecoming was coming up and she wanted to go with me as friends, and I brought her a form she had to fill out. It had a big bold letters that she needed I’d or she couldn’t go, she even pointed it out. I told her yea she’d need it , and she said ok. Week before homecoming I told her again she needed Id, she flipped out again texting me upset in the middle of class. Trying to calm her down while I’m trying not to cry I tell her the teacher selling the tickets would let us figure it out and give us more time. She then tells me she’s not going and blocks me. (Cried again that night too). 

Fast forward to about the start of this month, I said her I was giving her stuff for Valentine’s day(like I do with all my friends). Yea ik you don’t tell people but I wanted to plan out what to do, she goes on to tell me this week she won’t be there because she has surgery (which I understand) and apparently I was rude when I texted her when she was gonna be there. (It’s probably important that I’m going through a rough patch rn) here’s how the conversation went

A: why is there a stick up your ass?
Me: I wish there was a stick up my ass
A: well I don’t wanna listen to your attitude 😋
Me: well I don’t wanna hear you 24/7 but here we are. *blocked her*
Yesterday I asked her in person for her locker combo so I can give her the stuff I wanted to give her the things and she gave me an attitude (was expected) saying “apparently we aren’t on good terms so why would I give it to you” I shrugged, later just shoving the things through the holes in the locker.
I understand that we are both wrong but I just need to know if I should apologize.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-10T23:37:50.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aith for blocking my friend&lt;/p&gt;

Yea ik you don’t tell people but I wanted to plan out what to do, she goes on to tell me this week she won’t be there because she has surgery (which I understand) and apparently I was rude when I texted her when she was gonna be there. (It’s probably important that I’m going through a rough patch rn) here’s how the conversation went&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: why is there a stick up your ass?
Me: I wish there was a stick up my ass
A: well I don’t wanna listen to your attitude 😋
Me: well I don’t wanna hear you 24/7 but here we are. &lt;em&gt;blocked her&lt;/em&gt;
Yesterday I asked her in person for her locker combo so I can give her the stuff I wanted to give her the things and she gave me an attitude (was expected) saying “apparently we aren’t on good terms so why would I give it to you” I shrugged, later just shoving the things through the holes in the locker.
I understand that we are both wrong but I just need to know if I should apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

"I (26M) recently got into a disagreement with my ex wife (26F), we shall call her Sarah (fake name), over a TV stand.

It all started when we moved in together in 2018. (for context, We live in the lower half of my family's house); Sarah brought **her TV stand** with her while moving in. Its quite a nice TV stand too, having a space heater in it. Anyway Sarah had got this TV stand in her last relationship and held onto it when they split.

Fast forward to February 2023. Sarah came to me and told me she wanted a divorce and I agreed that it was for the best. I began working on the paperwork and she moved out and into her parents house. This is probably where I feel like I'm somewhat being a buttface; I told her **she could leave her stuff at my place until she had enough room at her parents for her things.**

Over the next few months Sarah would come and grab boxes of items then go on with her life. When we got close to the Divorce finalization date, My family that I live with started asking me when she was going to finish getting her stuff out of the house. From that point I reached out to Sarah and asked ""**would it be too much to ask for you get the rest of your items out by the first of August?**"" to which she responded ""**that's fine**"".

We got to the point where we had our final divorce paperwork filled out and I gave her the copies and the originals to sign and **she read through it over the course of an hour before signing**. At the part about our property it says ""We have already divided the property fairly. I ask the court to **order** that each spouse will **keep any personal property that they now have or control**"". July came and then our divorce was finalized. With that finalization the Judge signed the papers and the court order would be enacted for us to ""keep the personal property we now have or control"".

**I still allowed Sarah to come and get more things until August**, however I stayed firm on that last date. She got **most of her things out before August and didn't ask about anything else she left**, including the TV stand she left here. Cut to 3 weeks ago, Sarah texts me ""heads up, I'm planning on coming to get that TV stand in the next few months"" and after a long time thinking about it and how **I never stood up for myself in my relationship or marriage**, felt like it was time to finally stand up and tell her no. We had a bit of back and forth banter texts that ended when I quoted the Divorce papers, and her telling me ""You didn't tell me about that"" and my final response was ""You read the papers and signed them. It was not my job to tell you anything in the paperwork nor explain them to you.""

So reddit, Am I the buttface for saying no she couldn't have the TV stand she left at my place?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: After a few comments, Im glad to see that many people think im the buttface. As I stated in a few of the comments thus far, on the day Sarah and I had our convo, I took about an hour to reflect on myself and my actions. I felt like crap and a bad person, and for good reason. I was being petty and Vindictive, mostly over a more major argument months prior. I texted her again and we worked out a good time together for her to come pick it up by. 

Reason for posting this after already resolving the issue, I wanted to share my story and see if others thought I was being a butthole or if others thought I was justified.

"AITA For breaking up with my girlfriend?

So I 17 (M)have been dating my girlfriend (let’s call her Sam)17 (F) for about five months now, the past month I have been really in the dumps because of seasonal depression and I’ve also noticed that I have began losing feelings for my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me just about everything I want even if I don’t want her to get it for me every time I have stayed in her town she has paid for my motel room and overall she’s a great woman but I just don’t see her attractive anymore. And a few days ago she texted me asking if I was losing feelings and I told her that Idk. And eventually told her I was. My girlfriend has given me a lot, such as her love, time, money, and even her virg1ty. My girlfriend has been struggling the past few weeks with suc1d@l thoughts and a few days before I broke up with her. It was her best friends anniversary of their suc1de so she’s obviously been depressed. So with her being all emotional it’s been Annoying so I decided just to cut things off with her so I didn’t have to listen to her anymore, today when we called you were talking about if we were going to be friends still or not, and while we were on call, I noticed that her arms had a fresh cűts on them, I called her out and she started crying saying it was nothing She had obviously relapsed on self h@rm she was seven months clean and when I called her out, she started crying and saying she was sorry and I told her she was crazy.

"I (40M) am a manager in an office of around a couple dozen employees. Recently we brought on a new employee ""Stacy"" (22F) fresh out of college for an entry level position. Her credentials were solid, she was professional in her interview, and so far we've had no issues working with her.

Just yesterday, I received an anonymous email tipping me off about Stacy's social media accounts and posts. The email had links to her Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok accounts, all of which I went through. About half of her posts are bashing men, ranting about how selfish, toxic, and entitled men are, how she supposedly had to work twice as hard to get to her position as men, and how any woman she knows can do the job of her male colleagues better.

I was pretty angry and disappointed after I saw her posts. We had developed a good working relationship up to this point so I was blindsided to find out that she felt this way about myself and her male colleagues as well as held such misandrist views. I'm seriously thinking about firing her after seeing all her posts. My impression of her now is definitely a lot worse than it was previously and I know I'll always have this in the back of my mind when working with her going forward. It also might only be a matter of time before the guys in the office see her posts as well which can cause drama and resentment in the office. Things would be a lot easier if I just let her go right now rather than letting things escalate. I am a little hesitant though because she is honestly qualified for the position and she clearly didn't mean for any of the posts to be seen by those she has a professional relationship with.

After she nagged me to tell her my type, I gave up and told her I was into tall assertive, physically strong, smart girls with motherly vibes who can join in on my hobbies and we can just have fun together, like I want someone to love but I also want a best friend. for some reason my answer angered her she went on a whole rant about why we should break up because she doesn't fit my standards or she can't do any of them. she went to rant to her friends, they told her I was a disgusting pig and my preferences are more suited for trans women, I made a dumb move and told my GF I don't mind dating a trans a lot of them seem cool as heck. she exploded accusing me of being gay and hiding my homosexuality by dating her.

"I have a friend who is going through some tough times with her job and associated financial situation. She’s under a lot of financial stress.

To cheer her up a couple of weeks ago, I took her to dinner at a very nice steakhouse; the tab was about $500 before tip for the two of us. I paid before she even had a chance to offer to pay part of it, and I told her not to worry about it. What was important was to have fun that evening and enjoy the treat, if possible.

I know having fun had to be a challenge. During our dinner, she mentioned that she was short on her rent. I asked her how much, and it turned out to be almost all of it. I sent her a Venmo for it without her having to ask, and I told her to pay me back “whenever you can, but don’t worry about it”.

At some point in the evening, I mentioned the trouble I was having with a contractor that was repairing the shower in my master bath. The previous fixtures had broken, and I had no choice but to replace them. I’m excited about the new fixtures that I have chosen; they are high end European things that are beautiful, and I am adding a rain head, audio speakers, and redoing the pan tile while the contractor has the wall open. It is practical to go ahead and upgrade everything at once.

I shared that I had cancelled a planned theatre trip to NYC because I couldn’t justify spending the money on the shower AND taking a fancy trip. She was surprised and asked me how much the shower fixtures cost, and I was open and honest with her – about $16,000 plus the labor cost for the plumbing and drywall. About $25k all in. I showed her photos of the new fixtures and the tile I had chosen.

She has mostly ghosted me since then. Through a mutual friend I heard that she thinks that I am tone deaf and insensitive for talking about a luxury shower project when she is on the verge of eviction. She felt the money spent on dinner was a gross display of excess. She even criticized the level of car service I chose to transport us.

I get it. It has to be personally trying to witness others living a lifestyle that is free of financial concern when for her every day is a struggle right now. But I have real problems with that. I think it is pure hypocrisy to criticize my financial situation while also taking advantage of it. If the restaurant choice made her uncomfortable, she could have suggested a more modest place for dinner. I can’t reconcile her characterization of me as insensitive while I am paying her rent.

&lt;p&gt;She has mostly ghosted me since then. Through a mutual friend I heard that she thinks that I am tone deaf and insensitive for talking about a luxury shower project when she is on the verge of eviction. She felt the money spent on dinner was a gross display of excess. She even criticized the level of car service I chose to transport us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get it. It has to be personally trying to witness others living a lifestyle that is free of financial concern when for her every day is a struggle right now. But I have real problems with that. I think it is pure hypocrisy to criticize my financial situation while also taking advantage of it. If the restaurant choice made her uncomfortable, she could have suggested a more modest place for dinner. I can’t reconcile her characterization of me as insensitive while I am paying her rent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AITB for &amp;quot;flaunting&amp;quot; wealth in front of my struggling friend, even though I tried my best to help her?&lt;/p&gt;

"I know the title sounds terrible but hear me out lol. We live in a gated community that has several parks. There is a park directly across the street from our house and another park that’s bigger and better about 2 minutes down the road. Last weekend we met up with some of my sons (4) friends (4 &amp; 5) plus one of the friend’s older brother (13) and their moms. There were other kids at the park of course because it was a nice day. My son and his friends were playing with another boy (5). It’s important to note the mom of this boy was sitting at a picnic table on the outside of the park the entire time on her phone, while myself, my husband, and the moms of the other two boys were all talking following around our kids. They all had brought toys from home and were each chasing each other with those toys while also playing with each others toys. For example one boy brought action figures another brought a sword and the boy we didn’t know brought a little toy grabber thing. They had been playing with each other since about 1:30PM and when the incident happened it was about 4:00PM. So we are standing there talking and all of a sudden my husband yells “Don’t touch my kid!” And starts rushing over to our son. I had no idea what was going on and walked over as well. The lady of the son we didn’t know had grabbed my son’s shoulder and took the grabber toy from my son and handed it hers. After my husband yelled at the lady she immediately starts fast walking away saying “sorry sorry sorry he had my sons toy” my husband then says “so you tell his parent you don’t touch my kid” she then doesn’t respond and goes back to sitting down at the picnic table. We check on our son he’s fine and we decide it’s time to leave. Everyone we were there with left at this same time as well. It is also important to note one of the moms we were there with was about 15 feet from us and didn’t even know anything happened, showing how not loud my husband was. Well fast forward to that night and the mom that grabbed my son is posting on our community Facebook page telling other moms to watch out for this aggressive dad that screamed at her at the park. Others were commenting saying they were so sorry this happened to her. I of course commented after the other moms that were there were texting me about it. I defended my husband and commented what really happened still everyone that wasn’t there were defending this lady saying my husband must have anger issues and saying he must be abusive to me and our kids at home. Comments were then made that what my husband did was abusive and that the lady should file a police report for assault. Everyone we have told this story to has been on our side but I wanted outside opinions because I truly don’t feel we were in the wrong. 

The cops were called and came to my house. The park has cameras and caught the entire thing on video. The cops have ask us if we wanted to file a restraining order against the lady that grabbed our son but we have chosen not to at this time.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-10T00:22:01.000Z","post","Historical","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know the title sounds terrible but hear me out lol.

"Hi. For context, I’m 29 and female.

My mom and I have always had a rocky relationship. She's a heavy drinker with narcissistic tendencies which have caused issues ever since I became old enough to speak up for myself. Growing up, she's been verbally abusive and we've gotten into physical fights multiple times.

A few months ago, I was at a funeral for my boyfriend's great-grandmother and talking to his family about zodiac signs. To get more information, I asked my mom what time I was born. She responded that she didn't know and it was in my baby book. She told me she gave me my baby book, which she didn't I got concerned because she never gave this to me and she was insistent that she didI told her she didn't ever give it to me, and I was anxious about not knowing where it wentI told her if it turned up somewhere to let me know. She all of a sudden blew up on me, telling me how horrible her day was, and asking ""can you not do this right now?"" I was shocked at her response and honestly confused. I told her I also had a pretty crappy day and was at a funeralShe continued to try to argue with me, so I stopped replying.

Some time passed and I tried to talk things out with her, thinking there was clearly a misunderstanding or miscommunication. This turned into another argumentI ended up telling her that the only way I think we can work through our issues is if we go to therapy togetherI asked if she would be open to therapy to repair our relationship.

My sister also tried recommending accessible counseling for the two of us, and my mom responded that she was ""100% not doing that"". It's worth mentioning that my mom has been to couples therapy in the past with her late husband so therapy isn't necessarily something she was opposed to in general; just therapy with me it seems.

I explained to my mom that I don't think we can work through things without a third party like a therapist ba on all of our issues and her refusal made me feel like our relationship was unimportant to her. She took that as an opportunity to berate and belittle me, so I blocked her on all social media and blocked her number.

A few weeks later, I received an email from her shaming me for cutting her off and telling me I am ungrateful for her raising me. We went back and forth in emails a few times, still arguing, with me mostly trying to get her to understand my side to no avail. She told me not to reply to her email and that I was an inconsiderate and condescending person.

I responded anyway and told her I loved her and hoped we could resolve things in the future.

We went through thanksgiving, Christmas, new years, and now all of January without speaking. I still feel guilty for cutting her off, even though it has been better for my mental health. So, am I the buttface?

TLDR; my mom and I have a toxic relationship. I asked for therapy. She refused and went into attack mode. I cut off contact but I feel guilty.

So, I tried online dating for the first time and found a match. To summarize, the guy (let's call him Jose) said in his bio that he wants to start off as friends into something more serious. Also, the last time he dated was 4 years ago.

Within the first week of texting he already wanted to go to the movies. Of course, I was excited, until I had a gut reaction to him still being a complete stranger, and it would have been an empty theater. I declined and explained my discomfort to him. I was grateful that said he understood.

Fast forward to nearly 2 months later, and we have been talking almost every day. Jose seemed like a nice guy, but there are times when he'll leave me hanging while texting. I just assumed that he was busy or tired from work. No problem. I just left a bad crowd of people and want to meet like-minded people.

I feel comfortable enough to meet him in person. I asked for different places to meet, but Jose said he might have a mission (navy) coming up soon. I asked when would be a good time to meet. He said he's not sure. Fair.

I asked weeks later if Jose had any missions coming up. He says, ""No, why?.""...

So, I asked again if he still wanted to meet up, and he agreed quickly. We both agree to go to the museum in 2 weeks. During this time, we text every other day or so. Also, Jose said he had to make a life-changing decision, but he said it was nothing serious. I think maybe it's about his sick dog or something job-related. I just told him I'm here if he ever wanted to talk to me about it. He never told me what it was. Also, fine. It could be a sensitive topic, or he wants to talk about it when we meet. (He doesn't).

We finally met for the first time and had a lot of fun. Jose paid for my ticket, so I helped out with dinner. He was nervous but eventually calmed down. Interestingly, he would text on his phone when we didn't know what to say to each other, but he would put it away to give me his undivided attention when I spoke. It could have been his sisters, his roommate, nerves, I don't know.

I told Jose that I had a great time, to which he also agreed. Two days later, he apologized for not texting me as much because his girl was hogging all of his attention. I was confused. I asked if he meant his car, or his female dog. Nope, .... he has a girlfriend, and they have been dating for a month. A little bit shorter than we had been talking, and not once did he mention that he now dating his friends of 8 years!!

I quickly texted Jose saying I had to go, but he insisted that it was fine since his girlfriend was in the other room cooking. It left a terrible taste in my mouth hearing that. He asked how's my art project going. Defeated, I tell him it's not that important. He doesn't reply a thing until 5 days later with a simple ""Hey"". I just said, ""Hi"" and he still hasn't responded back in almost 20 hours.

"    Hi, I am a 26-year-old woman. This will be a long tale to tell so, bare with me. Tax season is important this year. My son and I have been struggling to live paycheck to paycheck for half a year. We managed to get some help and live. But, there was an issue regarding an inheritance...

    The inheritance was to my late grandmother who passed away a year ago. My grandmother had some ""values""which clash with me as I got older. She did have an account left in my name. With the verbal promise if I graduate college I could get the money. Now, present-day distribution of the inheritance. 

    You know how most say important life events like a funeral bring out the worst in people. Well, It did on my mom's side...like worse than what was expected. My mom kept a secret account to herself. While my mom pushed me to split the inheritance for two other siblings. Even more so, her brother was pushing her to cough up it faster. He would later cut everyone off and give bullshit excuses why. 

    At the time, I was focused on my son and new job position and building our lives. I didn't want to be involved in the will and I never wanted to be a part of it. I could be honest I don't even agree I didn't deserve the money due to our relationship. I did question one time why didn't I get any part of it when it was under my name. My mom would yell at me saying ""You never graduate college, you don't have any right to it."" This breaks my heart because I tried so hard to graduate school and failed. At the time too, we live with her rent-free and I just stay quiet even to keep my son away from the drama. I comply to do what she asks and hope to never think about this again. 

    Current time, I owe almost 4k in taxes to an inheritance that I never use a single penny of. The whole week I was crying, you want to know my mom side reaction. My aunt thought I shouldn't mind the heat even when my mom did favors for me. This was the time I thought I was getting 1.6K hit on me. My mom was in disbelief that I shouldn't have been hit hard even for money I never used. Even try telling me to amend my taxes and never file it. Though I'm not stupid and I know that is literally tax fraud. I told all my friends this story and they literally say I need to cut off all of them. 

     I didn't want anything to mess up my son and my livelihood. I told Mom to get the account out for my name even before her mother passed away. That I didn't want the money even with our relationship. I wasn't involved around the will even when they specifically requested no grandchild be involved. I even agree out of the things the money should have all gone to my mom since she took care of her until she died of dementia. I stuck up for her even with the BS they spew only to be hurt by her too. The only relief was my dad having no tolerance for it. He was going to have a chat with my mom calling bs for everything. My dad had my back but my mom didn't.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-09T20:11:26.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hi, I am a 26-year-old woman.

I'm a good cook! I would say it's my main hobby, and when I'm at home or my house is hosting dinners, I am the one who takes care of everything. People enjoy my cooking and that's where I find the most joy.

Because I am known as a good cook, when I moved in my friends sought my advice sometimes. What spices to use, how long things needed in the oven, what they could make with their ingredients, etc. I think the problem is that I got used to being sought out for cooking advice, because now I maybe tend to give it where it's not wanted.

It's never anything crazy, I never do it when being cooked for, or when my roommates are cooking for other people. But, if I come down to the kitchen for water, I might ask what someone is making, and then sometimes say ""can I make a suggestion?"" and tell them an additional thing they should add. Generally, it's chill and they say thanks and tell me later that I levelled up their meal.

Now, I think if I were to say I don't do it to show off that would be a bit disingenuous - I definitely enjoy being told I'm a good cook. Still, it is not my place to judge or attempt to control what other people cook and eat, and I am cognizant of this. I do not think I know better or am better than these people because I enjoy cooking.

The incident itself is small, but it has me reconsidering things and honestly freaking out a bit. Yesterday I came down to the kitchen and three of my housemates were hanging out, with one of them, Chris, cooking his dinner. I asked him what he was making, and but before he could respond, another housemate said ""Here comes Ramsay!"" they laughed, and I laughed with them, because I thought it was light-hearted. When it was followed up by the other with ""Don't tell her Chris, she'll just flex"", with a different tone, I realised that this was maybe actually something that has been annoying them.

I politely excused myself and waited until they had left for a night out before going and making my own dinner, because I was honestly too embarrassed to talk to them again. I thought I was being helpful, but maybe I was being annoying, controlling or arrogant? Or were they joking? How would you lot feel about it?

"For context, we live in an apartment that has a balcony with a sliding door that opens into my my roommate' (John) bedroom. John likes their room to be cold 24/7 and tends to keep the patio door open at all times.

&amp;#x200B;

A week or two ago, we recently had a family of Asian decent move into the apartment below us. John hadn't seen/met them yet and assumed that they were also white, so I had corrected them during an unrelated conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

In response, John chuckles and sarcastically says ""Oh, then maybe I shouldn't have been pretending to speak Vietnamese with my friend when we were playing videogames a few days ago"".

&amp;#x200B;

I told John that it wasn't funny and that they really shouldn't do this because their patio is directly above ours, and our neighbors would be able to hear. Imo, this could be seen as offensive and could be a cause for bad blood between us later down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

We ended up arguing about it and a John says that since they weren't directing it at anyone in particular, it wasn't racist or culturally insensitive. John also said that I was over reacting because I was worried about how that could come off to our non-english speaking neighbors, that ""it's not racist if it's said in the name of comedy"", and said ""I'm racist toward everybody"" in response.

"My (20M) boyfriend (23M), likes music. I mean ***really*** likes it. He often likes to sing when we're together in calls, and has made it his personal goal to ""move"" me with music. I have empathy and get emotional for my friends and loved ones, but music doesn't really affect me all that much. I listen to *The Score* to hype me up for workouts sometimes, but that's about it.

For context, I grew up in an incredibly musical household. My parents met on the set of a musical, both of them were in the choir, my sister is in a dance group and sings in her college choir, and my mom was a music teacher for a while. I hate singing in front of people, and singing in general is just...meh, for me. My parents were super chill about it when I became a teenager and expressed this properly to them, and stopped all efforts, though they and others often comment about how it's ""a shame"" I don't care for music or like singing.

Because of all this background, I don't like when people try to force me to feel something, especially relating to music. It's not necessarily a *bad* history, I guess, but I just don't like when people assume that everyone likes music and eventually I'll come around.

Sometimes he expects me to get sad when he shares an emotional story about how this music is connected to his heritage, and I often feel bad when I don't give the reaction that I feel like I should be giving. This has extended to him thinking I'm repressed or need to unlock something or feel safe and cry properly to music.

I love my boyfriend, he's sweet, considerate, and confident, and I love the stories that come with his songs! They're genuinely heartwarming, but the music itself just doesn't move me and I don't really like singing all that much, and I think it's making him think that I need to be changed. I don't want to be a stick in the mud or a total asshole by shutting him down, but I really don't care for all the assumptions.

"

 I'm in a weird mindset, I may have reacted to my friends trying to help me.  They were almost wasted too.

I (22 m) ended a two relationship with my ex-girlfriend because I found out she was cheating on me a few weeks ago. I've been staying home. Not doing anything but Marvel movies and takeout. I haven't done much since the breakup. All I do is go to work/school. I'm trying to snap out of this head space.

My friend, Chad (22 m) had his birthday last Friday. He invited me to go almost a month in advance before my breakup. I strongly considered not going but it was a dick move to ditch my friend.on his bday. Our friends, Kyle (23 m) and n (23 m) were also there. The party was at a bar. I low key bars or anything that might be loud due to my sensory issues but it's fine I force myself to act normal for a night. I'm used to it anyway.

While drinking beer and playing darts, Kyle commented that this girl kept checking me out. I said ""Cool"" and kept playing darts. He then said try to hook up with her. I told him ""No thanks, I'm not interested"". I'm still not over my ex and I don't feel like dating again. I thought he was joking, but continued talking I bought her a drink and saw where the night took us. I repeatedly no I don't want that. Chad offered me to led a condom. They all 3 kept bringing it up that I needed to go hook up with that girl. Or at least her a drink.

I snapped a little at them and told them to shut up then stormed out of the bar. I felt my getting and I went outside to calm down. 15-20 minutes later, I was still mad but I was calmer. I saw Kyle and Chad talking to 2 girls, one of the girls was the one checking me out, let's call her. Chloe. Ben left with someone.

Kyle waved me over, I reluctantly joined them. Chloe complimented my Ironman phone case and we talked for a long time, almost an hour. We had a lot in common. She asked me for my number. I was about to tell her no because I don't give it out to people I just met. Kyle gave my number off his phone number to Chloe.

She added it to her phone. Saying she'd text me later and left with her. Once out of earshot, I went off on Kyle that he had no right to do that. Chad is single too, he could have just given him to her. Chad joked that I should take all the help I could get. Kyle added if I don't want her. He'll take her. He has a girlfriend by the way. I was done. I couldn't handle them anymore. I walked out of the bar for good.

I went home. Chad and Kyle are calling me d-bag and AH for ditching them. How I ruined the celebration in our group chat. I muted it for now. I'm furious at both of them. Ben told me I was being a wimp and to get over my ex already. Everyone goes through a breakup it's nothing new.

AITB?

 On an unrelated note. Chole texted me. Saying she loves to have coffee and to know me better. She had a great time meeting me. That I seem to be nicer than the other guys she has met lately. I haven't responded. I'm not interested in dating right now. 

Update- 
I responded to Chloe last night. I nicely told her that coffee was good but asked if we could go as friends.i don't to want lead her on.  I told her that I got out of something serious and didn't want anything more. She said she understood and looked forward to that coffee soon. We talked for a long time over text. 

I haven't heard anything back from my friends. I get removed from our group chat. Wasn't given a reason as to why but I haven't spoken to them since the bar.

" On December 2nd my high school group chat was discussing their Spotify wrap. and they were talking about how everyone had Taylor Swift song lyrics on the slides. I made the heinous mistake of saying I did not like Taylor Swift. My exact words were, ""I despise Taylor Swift.""

Now, I have no evidence to believe she is a bad person, obviously, she has found some way to gain the system and make a hefty load of money. I've just never vibed with her music purely on the premise. I don't like the example of relationships depicted in her songs. Then I was forced to spend an entire summer listening to her, which did not improve my opinion, it worsened my opinion. (someone I volunteered with at my Tae-kwon-do studio had the TS station on every class) I explained all of this to back up my opinion. My taste in music is more akin to Maneskin and OUAT.

I was questioned on my use of language that was, ""too drastic for the topic at hand."" I do use strong language often, but it is to add variety in my writing. I also don't have any other artist that I can think of that causes the raging annoyance that TS does.

As expected, that angered the Swiftys at my high school. Someone looked up at least one, if not all, of the lyrics from the songs on my wrapped. And they found the cancel material they were looking for. My top artist of last year was Maneskin and my number 4 song was I Wanna Be Your Slave. This mysterious person started shit-talking me to a girl in my class, saying I was a hypocrite. I'm also the only known Catholic in my school so that was brought up.

Personally, I find this a tad bit amusing. Because I never claimed to be the stereotypical ""good Catholic,"" and Swifties are unhinged.

"This is going to sound petty and I agree that it is. My girlfriend likes to play board games and games together on the nintendo switch. Most of these game are just luck anyway with no skill needed but some of them you actually need skill.

  
I've been playing games a lot longer than my girlfriend so I am better at a lot of them. This means I win a lot of the time. Not all of the time  thoguh and there are still times my gf wins. The issue is she's starting to get annoyed whenever I win. I've tried talking to her about playing different games, maybe not playing at all if that's the reaction she has etc but she refuses. 

  
She said it's shit watching me win all the time and that I could always let her win at times. I mention that she's not a child and me letting her win would be obvious so wouldn't really change anything. I also point out a lot of the games are just luck anyway so I can't really do anything with that. 

  
She just repeated that it's shit for her to keep losing so I just repeated the suggestion of finding new games or just stopping playing but she said she doesn't want to. She said I should just want to enjoy playing the game with her and should be fine letting her win but I pointed out the same logic could be applied to her in that she should just be fine playing the game with me and be fine with me winning but she said it wasn't the same.

"I've been going to a specialist for two years now. He's in network, I really like him, and he is streets ahead of any other doctor I've seen in this field.   

My wife is currently experiencing a health issue that her company insurance did not cover. So, I put her onto my insurance. So, at the same time we are dealing with this, my health insurance deduction has gone up by $800 a month, and my yearly deductible has doubled. These are all points of anxiety for us, but we are managing.  

Today I received a call from the doctor's receptionist reminding me of an appointment that I have next week. I confirmed that I would be there. She informed me that she looked into my insurance and after determining that I have a high deductible, they are requiring me to pay for the entire cost of the visit up front.  

I explained that I've been going there for two years, have never paid a bill late, and in fact paid their bills typically within an hour of them hitting the patient portal, so I wasn't sure why the change. The receptionist replied, ""You have a high deductible, so we're not going to get paid if we send it to your insurance.""  

I told her that I had added a dependent, but that as long as my bills were paid, which they always were, that my deductible was none of her business, and I considered it an invasion of my privacy for her to be looking at anything other than if the doctor was in my plan.  

She started laughing and said, ""That's not an invasion, I'm allowed to look at your coverage to determine if we're going to be paid.""  

At this point I lost my cool. I asked, ""Excuse me, did you just laugh at me? Do you find this funny? Because I do not. I am very upset by this, and you're laughing at me?""  

She stopped laughing and lied, ""No, I wasn't laughing I was just saying I have the right to review your coverage and determine if we'll be paid, and we're not going to get paid if you don't pay up front.""  

I again stated that in two years I had never failed to pay them, even when I was under my deductible, and that should suffice as proof that they will be paid.  

She replied, ""Well, we have people in collections who never paid. Some people ruin it for everyone, and because you have a high deductible we won't get paid.""  

Frustrated that she had again stated that I wouldn't pay them, I asked, ""Am I in collections? Have I ever been in collections? Have I ever failed to give you the money that is owed to you?""  

She replied, ""It doesn't matter, this is our policy and you will need to pay for the visit up front.""  

I told her I did not appreciate the way I was spoken to and that I would be speaking to the doctor to determine whether or not I would be continuing as a patient.  

The receptionist said it was the doctor's decision to require this for all high deductible patients. So if that's true, my only recourse is to drop him. I have the money, I am able to pay in advance, but I am not okay with being treated like a deadbeat.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-10T08:28:33.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been going to a specialist for two years now.

"I (96M) have been living with my wife, in-laws, daughter and grandson (9M) in a single house for decades now. Due to depression and illness, I've never gotten out of bed in 20 years and neither have my wife or in-laws. This obviously necessitates bedpans and sponge baths. My daughter and grandson have been working low-paying jobs to support our family of six, which means our diet consists mainly of cabbage soup.

As you all know, famous chocolatier Willy Wonka has been running the golden ticket contest promising a lifetime supply of chocolate. My grandson loves chocolate but rarely gets to have it because we're poor. I decided to use my tobacco money to buy him a chocolate bar, which unfortunately didn't have a ticket. 

Yesterday afternoon, however, my grandson came home with the last golden ticket! I was no longer depressed or bedridden, so I jumped out of bed, started dancing and asked my grandson to take me to the factory with him. Instead of saying yes, he, his mom and even my wife and in-laws got angry and started yelling at me for ""pretending to be bedridden"" for 20 years while my family starved. 

Long-story short, my grandson went to the factory with his mom while I was made to work in her place. Additionally, my grandson has inherited Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and everyone in my family is allowed to move in except me, who has been served with divorce papers and an eviction notice.

"My (22NB) Dad (49M) was adopted as a baby. I've never spoken to him about it because it felt like an awkward subject to bring up.

I've been looking at DNA kits since I was 16, I have multiple chronic health problems and I'm curious to know if there's a genetic component to it  since half of my DNA is basically a mystery. I'm also at an age where I'm thinking about having kids in the not so distant future and I want to know if there's anything genetic I should worry about.

I think I'd rather do it without asking and deal with potential consequences later since I'm low contact with my dad and paternal grandparents but I also don't want to destroy the relationships I do have.

If I did happen to match with anyone I'd like to get to know them. I know they're not 'family' but they're genetically linked to me and my close family is small (4 grandparents, 2 parents, 2 uncles and a brother) so I think it would be cool if I discovered someone related to me on that side but I think the chances are pretty small.

" My girlfriend and I live together and before we moved it together we agreed to split rent and bills 50/50 since we have similar incomes. There was a couple of months that my gf went to part time with not a lot of hours and she asked if I would pay extra until she started university and got her student loan since, while she could afford the rent and bills, she wouldn't have a lot left over. I agreed and helped out but paying extra for 5-6 months.

My girlfriend has been offered a full time job with a salary that is £8500 a year more than me. I spoke with her about changing how we split the rent and bills since our incomes will no longer be similar. I suggested 60/40 or even 55/45 and said we could work out the actual percentage split based on income but my gf just said that isn't fair since she's planning to buy a car so the extra money is going to go towards that.

I pointed out its unfair of her to expect me to help pay her side of the bills when I am making more but then refuse to offer the same to me.

I said it's only fair that we change how the bills are divided and that rent and bills come before a car. She said I was being unreasonable since I knew she wanted a car but I just said that's not relevant since rent and bills come first. She again refused and said she shouldn't have to pay any extra.

I (16 female) was in class talking with my friend (16 male) , this Friend is often picked on because he’s quite nerdy and a large guy, so these idiots who often pick on my Friend started making snarky remarks, I was quite fed up by them so in a moment of anger I leaned closer to one of them and said ‘if you talk to us again, I’ll cut your dick off.‘

the friend I was sticking up for found it hilarious but my other friend said it was uncalled for and I shouldn’t have said anything but I was so fed up by it and I don think I was an ass,

"Update: screw Crayon, and screw trying to get the last word. He can sit in silence and suffer from the consequences of his actions. While it may give me a little satisfaction, would it be worth it? Heck no. After all the stupid things he did, he doesn't get the honour of getting more out of me.

Also made some edits for clarification/grammar

This text is about my experience with an online friend named Crayon. Initially, we had casual interactions. We started playing together more frequently, exchanged social media accounts, and even referred to each other by our real names. However, he left the game because of another player. But he came back not to long after that!

During a candle run, I accidentally called him by his in-game name instead of his real name, which resulted in him blocking me briefly. He explained that, and that his previous block was due to a fallout with a different friend.

Eventually, Crayon confessed his feelings for me, which I misunderstood as platonic. He expressed a desire for a romantic in-game emote specifically to do with me, which further confused me, because I just didn't connect the two dots.

During a conversation on Instagram, Crayon made a disturbing comment about imagining my body, after I told him I was going to have a shower. He only apologised after I pointed out that he never said sorry. Despite these instances, I didn't block him (even though I probably should've). 

Later on, during another candle run, Crayon confessed his romantic feelings for me. I explained that I did not return those feelings, which led to him no longer wanting to be friends. I tried to get him to stay, but his only response was that he'd have to ""continue suppressing a love that would never blossom"".

Before blocking me on all platforms, Crayon expressed his inability to suppress his unrequited love and sent me a song called ""You Don't See Me"" by Safetysuit. Its lyrics about not being seen the same way hurt me too, because he only saw me as a GF, while I only saw him as a friend. He unblocked me after about a week. 

Since then, I have blocked him myself and now feel tempted to unblock him temporarily just to tell him how much what he did hurt before blocking him again, because I want to be the one who gets the last word.

"So I formed a study group with some other people in one of my college classes at the beginning of the semester. About a week ago, we had our first midterm and just received our grades for it, and it turns out I did significantly better than the rest of the group (I got a 94, they got scores in the 80s and 70s). While I'm thrilled with my score since I was actually expecting it to be a few points lower, I also feel a little guilty knowing that everyone else in group didn't do as well.

When the other people in the group asked me about my grade, I decided to downplay my grade and told them I scored lower than I actually did - I just subtracted 10 from my score in my head and told them I got an 84. My reasoning was that I didn't want to make anyone feel bad or create any tension within the group, since they are typically very conscious about their grades and want to do well, and I feel like they would be jealous and resentful of me if they knew I was doing better than them. 

This issue isn't just with the exams. Since the beginning of the semester, I was doing better on the homework assignments in the class and telling them I got lower scores than what I actually got. I really just wanted them to feel that we were all in the same boat and on the same level so we wouldn't get competitive with each other. I don't like competition. 

I feel like I may be a buttface in this scenario but for understandable reasons. I am posting because I am curious if anyone else agrees or not that I may be a buttface, or if it really doesn't matter in the long run and I am overthinking all of this.   


I mean, they may never find out that I wasn't being honest with them and I could get away with it, but I doubt that would change the fact that it's kind of toxic and manipulative. But at the same time, it feels like a no-win situation because they would most likely still hate me if they knew I was getting better grades than them.

"I (20F) live in a college apartment with three other girls. We have two parking spots that come free with our unit. Two of the girls had cars when we first moved in, so the spots were naturally used by them. With the start of the new semester, I brought my car to school with me. One of my roommates is often gone so I park in the open spot, but will tell me when she's coming back so she can have the spot back. Parking has been okay finding on the street, but past a certain time (around 8:30pm) I can't leave or else I will come back to no street parking. My roommate usually stays over the weekends, which forces me to stay in out of fear of losing my street parking. After about a month of this, I'm getting frustrated not being able to leave late at night so I brought up the idea of sharing the spots with my roommates. I suggested we rotate the person who must park on the street by the week. My roommate who is gone pretty often said that she can't parallel park and would rather buy a new spot. All of the spots around our unit are sold out and the closest one is up the street and would require each of us to pay $100. We are paying the price of a full year to only utilize it for about 4 months. I think this is ridiculous as there is more than enough street parking during the day and there is also a parking garage the same distance that is only $1 per hour (max $8 per night). And I'm a college student, I don't want to pay nor have $100 for a spot not even close to my apartment! Her other suggestion was that she tells me when she's coming back from being home so that I can move out the spot before the street parking fills up, but again that doesn't eliminate my problem of not being able to leave at night. And I do not think it's fair that I have to move whenever she decides she wants to come back. I didn't think it was too big of an ask for them to manage their time a few weeks in the semester to get street parking so that no one has to pay anything.

"I live with my girlfriend and we live in the UK. I work from home and don't mind public transport for when I need to go out so I have no interest in getting a car. My girlfriend is starting a new job where she will need a car. 

She found one she likes and complained that the insurance was going to be expensive and asked if I would pay a monthly fee towards it. I asked if she was going to put me on the insurance but she said no, she wants it to just be her on the insurance. 

I told her I didn't really want to pay for a car i can't drive and that I'll give her petrol money when we go out together in it but that's all I'll be paying. 

She said I was being unfair since I'd still benefit from it since we'll be getting public transport less. I said you can't force a benefit on someone when they didn't ask for it and just expect them to pay. She said I wasn't being reasonable and that she isn't asking for much.

"It has been 3 days since our argument and barely talked to me. My boyfriend 26m asked me 24f to come to the mall with him at 1:00. I agreed but we both knew we had to pick our son up at 3:45. He's driving to the mall (which is 15 mins away in an area we grew up in) and he's not really talking to me. I ask him what's up and he starts talking about the situation from my previous post. But he's explaining how I wasn't being understanding, and he only yelled because he was tired and he had to argue with our 4 year old to go to bed.

I had no idea he was tired, he said he was going to take a nap before I got home. And from the time I hung up the phone to the time it took me to drive home, our son fell asleep with in at most 20 minutes. Which is super fast for our son. Regardless, I didn't think it was cool for him to suddenly yell at me without any explanation. And when I explained that the nights before, I spoke in my normal tone.

Anyway, I explain all this and another argument ensues. We're talking back and forth for like an hour in the mall parking lot. Were mainly talking about the other night and how he thinks I should have been understanding. And when i try and explain myself he says thats not even what hes mad about. I'm starting to get really frustrated arguing for so long in the car with the windows up.  I try to change the subject by asking what he's even mad about but that doesn't work. So I start telling him I'm getting frustrated and need a break from the conversation, since it's been an hour. He keeps talking and I get frustrated asking to end the conversation so I just say ""I'm frustrated and instead of yelling at you I'm taking some space. Please pick up our son, I'll meet you home."" He says no and I leave and go into the mall. @2:36

He's texting me asking me to come back but I'm so mad, I just text I'm taking space so it's not a screaming match. I walk around and I'm still mad by 2:50. So I just call an Uber so I can get to my car on time to pick up my son. When I'm in the uber I text him and tell him I left because I was too frustrated to be stuck in the car arguing with him again and I needed to pick our son up. 

My logic was that if I was still mad when I got in the car I would end up yelling at him. The he'd say if it was okay for me to yell, why are we arguing about him yelling at me. But if I just didn't talk, he'd say I'm giving him the silent treatment and not communicating=me being disrespectful. So i opted to Uber home to calm down, pick our son up on time and he could still shop for his pants. He knew the area because he has lived in this city his entire life and he drove his own car. I wouldn't have left if I knew he wouldn't be fine.

Now he's saying I abandoned him and that if I ask anyone they'll say I was disrespectful. But I thought it was the best choice. My only regret is asking him what was wrong in the first place.

Please pick up our son, I&amp;#39;ll meet you home.&amp;quot; He says no and I leave and go into the mall. @2:36&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s texting me asking me to come back but I&amp;#39;m so mad, I just text I&amp;#39;m taking space so it&amp;#39;s not a screaming match. I walk around and I&amp;#39;m still mad by 2:50. So I just call an Uber so I can get to my car on time to pick up my son. When I&amp;#39;m in the uber I text him and tell him I left because I was too frustrated to be stuck in the car arguing with him again and I needed to pick our son up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My logic was that if I was still mad when I got in the car I would end up yelling at him. The he&amp;#39;d say if it was okay for me to yell, why are we arguing about him yelling at me. But if I just didn&amp;#39;t talk, he&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;m giving him the silent treatment and not communicating=me being disrespectful. So i opted to Uber home to calm down, pick our son up on time and he could still shop for his pants. He knew the area because he has lived in this city his entire life and he drove his own car. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have left if I knew he wouldn&amp;#39;t be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now he&amp;#39;s saying I abandoned him and that if I ask anyone they&amp;#39;ll say I was disrespectful. But I thought it was the best choice. My only regret is asking him what was wrong in the first place. AITBF?&lt;/p&gt;

" 

I normally work from home but when I do have to go into the office I get the train. To get to the station I either have to get a bus that only comes every hour and then walk for 25 mins or get a taxi. Normally the taxi is a reasonable price so I don't mind paying.

I was at the office today so got a taxi to the station and got the train to work. On the way back my train was delayed by 40 mins and then when I got back the taxi prices had increased to over 3x their usual amount due to demand. My girlfriend was at home not doing anything so I asked if she would be able to drive and pick me up.

It is only a 15 min drive so isn't too bad and I often pay towards petrol and told her I'd do the same today. She refused and told me to make my own way back since she wasn't planning to leave the apartment. I was a bit upset since I wasn't really asking for much so I walked to the bus station and it took me over an hour to get home on top of the fact I was already delayed with the train.

My gf could tell there was something wrong and asked what was up. I just said that it hurt a bit that she wouldn't do a small favour for me and that I wasn't asking for much. She just asked why she should have to pick me up when she was already home. I just said in relationships you should do small things to help the other person out when you can.

I pointed out I regularly run to the shop on an evening for her when she wants something even though I wouldn't have otherwise been going but she just said it's different since the shop is closer. She said I was guilt tripping her but I just mentioned that I was only talking about how I felt and she just repeated that I shouldn't have expected her to come and pic me up when she didn't need to.

"I (21f) am a college student. I have lots of assignments, presentations, &amp; tests that I have to do (basically the amount of work for 14 weeks condensed to only 7 weeks so its very stressful &amp; REALLY fast.) My mom knows I'm busy because I tell her how stressed I am all the time. This is what happened:

Mom: ""Hey, can you take these towels up and put them in the bathrooms."" 

Me: ""I can't right now. I have a bunch of assignments and one of them is due tomorrow."" 

My mom didn't take that well. She began yelling at me to do the job and if I didn't I would be in big trouble. I genuinely pleaded to her to just let me go and finish the assignments (because they take a lot of time, I was in the zone and didn't want to break the focus because its rare that I work that fast.) I told her that I have to do this because it's really important and she can get one of my 4 other siblings to do it instead because I'm just too busy. My mom persists &amp; says, ""I DON'T CARE THAT YOU HAVE WORK. YOU ARE A GIRL AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME. COME BACK HERE AND DO IT NOW.""

I didn't want it to look like I was ignoring her so I just kept repeating that I just needed to finish my work, walked into my room, closed the door, and began working. Not even a second later, my mom walked into my room, took my Macbook and phone, and left. I ended up just sitting there for a while wondering why my mom had the sudden urge to do something like this when she knows I have things to do, and she KNOWS how much stress I'm in already since she has heard from her friends and family about how stressful the program is (because some of my family and her friends also took the program and also described it as being difficult) My little brother then came back and gave me my MacBook, but my phone was still with my mom. I continued working on my assignment (an e-portfolio) and when my brain got fried, I decided to give myself a few-minute break. During that time, I went downstairs and brought the towels up (mom WITNESSED this), I got my phone back, then went back to my room. I handed in my e-portfolio assignment at 5 AM because it was a complicated process and didn't know how to work the software for a long time.

When I woke up the next day, I noticed my mom was ignoring me. She dropped me off to school with no word to me and she's making me feel guilty. I told my dad the whole thing and he basically just wants me to hug her and tell her I'm sorry as a quick solution but that doesn't make sense either. I didn't even do anything wrong... I told my dad this, and he got mad that I wouldn't just take his advice.

This whole thing is just adding more stress on me (adding on that I have a test tomorrow and I need to study) but I'm completely exhausted, feeling guilty, and I genuinely don't know what I did wrong. (my mom didn't even TELL ME why she is ignoring me right now.) I genuinely don't know so this is my last resort. I can't ask my siblings because in the past, they have been very biased against me.

"I (18 enby) had a friend, who I'm gonna call L, since the 8th grade. I wouldn't say we were really close friends-- I didn't even consider her a best friend-- but when we were at school, we always hung out, even when we got into high school and didn't have that many classes together anymore. Well, starting this year, our senior year, I've noticed L hanging out with this girl, who I'm gonna call Donna, more and more. Obviously, I had no problem with it. L has a lot of different friends. It wasn't uncommon to see her hanging out with said friends.

But throughout the first semester of school, I've noticed L would stop waiting for me to get off the bus in the morning (L, Donna, and I ride the same school bus) and only wait for Donna, and then during break, L wouldn't stick beside me anymore. She would rush to find Donna. I tried to remain close to L, but I would get constantly ignored and talked over.

What really broke me and made me decide on distancing myself was the last full week before Christmas break. Donna wasn't at school for the entire week, so L waited for me to get off the bus in the morning AND stuck beside me during break. But then, the last two days before the break, Donna was back, and L stopped waiting for me.

In my eyes, I became that friend you hang out with when your main friend wasn't around. It was exhausting. L would only pay attention to me when Donna wasn't around.

"I (f20) and my boyfriend (m23) have been in an off and on again relationship since i was 18. We’ll call him Chris for the post. For context, he has broken up with me four times and every time Chris has given the some sort of variation of “i want to live my life unattached and free” and “this is getting to serious and i’m not ready.” 
Anyways the problem arose today as we were on the phone discussing future children and how i wanted to home school them for personal reasons. We discussed if our kids were potentially apart of the LGBTQ community and how’d we feel about it. I personally (and hope i won’t get too much hate here) said i wouldn’t care if my kid was gay or straight, but if they were trans id be supportive to a point but wouldn’t pay for any gender affirming surgeries until they were 25 because that’s when your frontal cortex of the brain fully develops and that a very serious and life/ body altering decision. 
Chris on the other hand said if they were gay or trans he’d say to their face “i’m extremely disappointed in you” and completely stop talking to them. Cut them out of his life. I don’t know anymore if this is someone i want to marry and build a life with. Especially if Chris would abandon our children over who they love and how they want to live their life. 
We’ve had several problems in the past and i don’t know anymore. This seems like the tipping point for me. Our relationship has been loveless for sometime and i’ve felt like a backup plan for him. I’m just at the point of how can you accept me (bisexual) and not accept your future children. I couldn’t live with a partner like that. At the end of the day, I’d choose my children no matter what over my partner in a second. 
What should I do because his decisions are always final and he never budges. Should I break up with him? Or should I look past this because apart of me loves him?

EDIT: a bit of context, there are two things. One is we have been engaged for awhile for that is why we are even discussing children and it would obviously be in a few years. It was supposed to be just a friendly discussion. Two is Chris is in the military. Our first breakups were mostly due to him being stationed in another country. I won’t say for obvious reasons

UPDATE: Thanks for everyone’s input and I do want to say I have ended things with Chris and will be focusing on myself for awhile. He didn’t take it well and blamed me for everything. Called me nasty names and i cried very hard. I was a fool living in old memories of what our relationship used to be and i missed the signs that it was done. I’ve gone back to therapy starting today. Took strangers on the internet to realize I’ve just replace one mess with another when it comes to men in my life. I know my views aren’t agreeable but growing up in a christian conservative household they are far better than once were. I’m trying to improve everyday. Thank u so much again everyone.

" I live with my partner and in a couple of weeks, she's away for the weekend with work. I was thinking about what to do over the weekend and sked my best friend if he wanted to meet up and go for a few drinks. He lives in a different town so normally when we meet, I go to his and stay over and when he comes to my town we tend to only meet briefly and he'll get a taxi or a train home.

Since I have the place to myself I mentioned that he could stay on the sofa if he wanted so he could stay over a bit longer. I mentioned he could stay the full weekend if he wanted but the chances are that he would only stay for 1 night and go home.

I mentioned this to my girlfriend and she just said no. She said she doesn't want anyone staying in the apartment and that I can go and stay at his. I told her that I prefer going for drinks in our town since the bars are better. She just said he isn't staying over but wouldn't say anything else when I tried to ask why.

I pointed out she isn't even going to be here so it doesn't affect her and she just repeated that no one is staying at the apartment. She said he can always go home early but I mentioned that would mean he can't stay for long and that we were planning to go out to a few bars and it would be too expensive for him to use a taxi home.

" I have been with my partner for 2 and a half years and for the last year and a half I've been working full time while also doing exams through work to become properly qualified. My exams finish next year and I thought I'd treat myself. Something I've wanted to do for years is go on a cruise.

My gf has always said she has no interest in this and hates the water so the idea of going on a cruise is not appealing to her so she wouldn't want to go on the trip. I decided to book one for next year so I was having a look last night at what options I have.

I mentioned to my gf what I was planning and she asked what that means for us going on holiday next year. I told her we'd still be able to go away it'll just likely to have to be a bit later than we usually go and that it would probably have to be slightly shorter than the holidays we've done for the last 2 years.

She said I wasn't being fair since I was this meant the holiday she'd be going on next year would be shorter because of my actions. I pointed out she is welcome to join me on the cruise and she said no and I mentioned she could always go away with friends or on her own if she wanted. She said she doubts her friends will go and she doesn't want to go on her own.

I just explained that I wanted to do something nice for myself for finishing my exams so thought this was the perfect time to do something I've wanted to do for years. She just accused me of not prioritising the relationship and just repeated that it wasn't fair that we're going away for a shorter time next year because I want to do the cruise.

My exams finish next year and I thought I&amp;#39;d treat myself. Something I&amp;#39;ve wanted to do for years is go on a cruise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gf has always said she has no interest in this and hates the water so the idea of going on a cruise is not appealing to her so she wouldn&amp;#39;t want to go on the trip. I decided to book one for next year so I was having a look last night at what options I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned to my gf what I was planning and she asked what that means for us going on holiday next year. I told her we&amp;#39;d still be able to go away it&amp;#39;ll just likely to have to be a bit later than we usually go and that it would probably have to be slightly shorter than the holidays we&amp;#39;ve done for the last 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said I wasn&amp;#39;t being fair since I was this meant the holiday she&amp;#39;d be going on next year would be shorter because of my actions. I pointed out she is welcome to join me on the cruise and she said no and I mentioned she could always go away with friends or on her own if she wanted. She said she doubts her friends will go and she doesn&amp;#39;t want to go on her own.&lt;/p&gt;

"I'm 17 and have undoubtedly suffered from low self esteem and anxiety. And I have trouble putting myself out there. I'm currently on a CAHMS waiting list which is a mental health service for under 18s in the UK. The NHS is strained and therefore the waiting period is massive until I can be seen. 

I always dreamt to be this person and coming out of school the lack of routine and more freedom I was just given made me hide in a shell more and feel more lonely. But home is my comfort zone and sitting on a couch like a potatoe aswell.

" I live with my girlfriend and we've recently moved into a new apartment. For the essentials we've both paid for things so we needed a dining room table and chairs, tv stand, sofa, bed etc so we both paid 50% each.

The problem is now my girlfriend keeps seeing things she says we need and buying them and expecting me to pay. A few examples are that she buys plants and a lot of decorative things and just says she expects me to pay her half of the cost.

I tried talking to her about it and saying that I don't appreciate my money being spent for me and that if she wants me to pay for something then we can talk about it first and agree together whether we need it or not. She went shopping last week and came back with new blinds and curtains despite nothing being wrong with the ones we have and just expected me to send her half of the money.

I said if she just keeps buying whatever she wants then she can pay for it herself. She said she's only buying things we need but I pointed out that we don't need most of the stuff she's buying and that she's only getting it because she thinks look nice.

She just repeated that I should be fine with paying since it's things for our apartment but I just tried explaining she's just buying things she likes and expecting me to fund it which is not going to happen.

She has to shadow another member of the team who does the same job she will be doing. They get on well but she's mentioned that other people at work have commented on him liking her and saying they seem like a couple. 

She also mentioned that he spend a lot of time complaining to her about his girlfriend and his relationship. According to my girlfriend she's the only one he complains about his girlfriend to. He also refuses to invite her to work events where peoples partners are invited.   
  
They have each other on social media and will message a bit outside of work. It started sounding like he was getting too close so I told my girlfriend I was starting to feel a bit uncomfortable since it looks like he's clearly interested in her and other people are picking up on it.  
  
She asked what I wanted to do and I said to just maybe remind him to keep things professional and not to message as much outside of work possibly and then when she's not shadowing him to maybe put some distance between them so he doesn't get the wrong idea and to make sure things remain professional.   
  
She got annoyed and said no and that she shouldn't have to do any of that since nothing is happening between them. I said I know that but I don't really want it to get to the point where he tries anything with her. She accused me of not trusting her which I told her was not true.

"I have a group of friends from university and we had all planned go on holiday once we finished university. Unfortunately that was 2020 so it didn't go ahead of obvious reasons and then once the world got back to normality, we all had jobs and it was a nightmare to align our free time.  
  
One of my friends has an uncle that has a villa in Greece that he said my friend can use in the summer. The friend set up a group chat with everyone who was supposed to go away in 2020 and suggested this summer and said we could use the villa for 7-10 days. Greece is somewhere I've wanted to go for a while so I said yes and was excited and everyone else said they would come.  
  
I told my girlfriend what I was planning and she looked annoyed. She asked what about us going on holiday in the summer. I said we still could go away for 4-5 nights but it might just need to be slightly later/earlier than usual but she said no and she wants to go away for longer and that she wants to go in the middle of the summer.  
  
I apologised but said that this is likely the only chance I'm going to get to have the holiday with these friends whereas we will be going away every summer. She said I shouldn't be going on a lads holiday while I'm in a relationship.  
  
She just repeated that it's disrespectful to be going and that I should be prioritising our relationship and not going on a lads holiday but I just repeated that this was the only chance I'm going to have to go with these friends so I'm going to take it.

So sorry I’m writing this on mobile. Me(F23), my girlfriend (F27) who I’ll call Ava and my (M25) who I’ll call Jake when to a little get together with some other friends, it was a bonfire type thing with about 6 people besides us. Jake was known to have a thing for me a while ago but when he tried to kiss me I swerved and said I was a lesbian (which is true) he pouted for a bit but said it was mostly because I swerved so hard and not necessarily because I rejected him.

Around last year I met a girl online and we went on some dates and really clicked, Ava’s a really conventionally attractive woman and she has a darker alternative style, while mine is more vibrant and bright, hers his a lot of whimsical witchy stuff. I’m saying this because honestly one of the first weird things he did was talk about how she was a “hot goth chick” and “alt girls always look crazy hot” and just wouldn’t shut up about it until all our friends said it was gross of him.

Recently at this bonfire he came up with tipsy and began talking about our intimacy life, what we do and use for example. We both kinda shuffled away and said we’d avoid him but he followed us around asking invasive questions, then eventually he started saying “if you all ever want to try the real thing let me know, I’m happy to give you the experience” it was gross and we kept saying to stop gradually getting more stern till I flipped.

I remember explicitly saying while also tipsy “holy f*ck! Can you leave us the hell alone? Neither of us want you in our bed! I can bet we’ll be better off without your thing in us than with it, go away cuz we aren’t entertaining your fetish sh*t anymore!” Though I’ll say in my semi drunk state it probably wasn’t as coherent or well said as I phrase it. My girlfriend said some things but I don’t remember it well, anyway, all yesterday and today morning even been receiving some texts saying he felt bad and all that wasn’t necessary when so many people were around.

 Apparently he’s really embarrassed and has gone around saying he feels to awkward now and he doesn’t feel he can joke with girls anymore cause “he never clocked his behavior as anything but a joke” so I do feel sorry he didn’t mean it but I think he should understand it’s not tasteful to speak like that especially when he’s been told to stop.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-04T04:17:36.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So sorry I’m writing this on mobile.

"I 24f have been telling my bf 26m that I want to work on my social anxiety and start making friends. We have been together for 9 years. For many reasons, I haven't had close friends since highschool. He said that he's worried about me making friends and that he's feeling insecure about how those relationships will effect our relationship. I reassure him everytime that things will be alright.

Wednesday, I decided that I was going to go out at 9pm on Friday. I invited my bf and two, not so close, ex coworkers that he knows. Friday comes, my boyfriend knows the plans. He was in charge of getting our son 4m in bed at 8pm, because I would be otw home from work at that time. Before I left to go to work at 5, I made sure the house was clean and dinner was ready so there would be no problems when I got home. My son's grandmother was going to stay home with him. 

At 7:45, i was at work my boyfriend called asking to give our son melatonin so we could go out. I told him not to because our son woke up at 4am that morning and didn't nap the entire day and i dont want to give it to him if he's already exhausted. I could hear our son arguing how he wasn't ready to go to bed. At 8, I hung up and drove 12 mins home and our son was asleep when I got home. 

I started to get dressed as soon as I got there and my bf sat on his phone. I offered to help him find something to wear and he made a comment about how I need to help myself because I was in my underwear. I explained that I was looking for an outfit and i was only offering because he said he had nothing to wear and were tight on time. Then he yelled at me saying he needed a minute after having to argue with our son about bed time. We bickered, so I told him he didn't have to yell and got up and went to the bathroom. 

I'm dressed at 8:35. I tell him I'm ready but he's sitting in the same spot. I ask him if he's even going and then we start to argue. He's saying we should have just given him melatonin and I need to pick his outfit. I reiterated what I said earlier and we continued to argue about how I shouldnt rush him. At that point I felt like he was intentionally trying to make us late, because he had from when he got home at 3pm till when I got home from work to find an outfit. So, I'm frustrated and start talking to him like I speak to our son. ""I dont want to argue. I want to get there at a good time. You can get up now and we can figure out the outfit or I'll just go with out you."" 

He said he didnt like how i was talking to him and not to invite him to things if his presence is optional. He also said he didn't ask for help he just wanted a second to sit and that it was clear I didn't want to go or else I'd be helping him find an outfit. Frustrated, I told him to just put something on if he was coming and went to warm the car up. When I came back inside, he was sitting in the same spot with no clothes on. So I left him and had a good time with my coworkers.

He's mad at me but i don't feel bad about it. So, am I the buttface for leaving him after he showed no motivation to get ready?

Edit** Our son was home asleep with his grandmother. She lives with us.

Update 2/5 we got into a huge fight about how he was tired and that's why he yelled. He said that I was not understanding enough about him being tired. I had no idea he was tired, until after he yelled about it.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-04T02:01:33.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I 24f have been telling my bf 26m that I want to work on my social anxiety and start making friends.

So I left him and had a good time with my coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s mad at me but i don&amp;#39;t feel bad about it. So, am I the buttface for leaving him after he showed no motivation to get ready?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit** Our son was home asleep with his grandmother. She lives with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2/5 we got into a huge fight about how he was tired and that&amp;#39;s why he yelled. He said that I was not understanding enough about him being tired. I had no idea he was tired, until after he yelled about it.&lt;/p&gt;

A few months ago, early September, I had an episode of psychosis, and became extremely paranoid of everyone and all of my friends. I truly started thinking that my friends were conspiring against me, and I had to stay with family while I was being put on medication to control the delusions. 

My best friend at the time, let’s call her Nancy, reacted by blocking me on everything. She texted me and said she needed space, and then blocked me on every outlet, and still has me blocked. We have been best friends for nearly 6 years, and she recently gave me art and collages with notes saying I was her best friend and it was destiny that brought us together. The weekend this psychosis episode happened was my birthday weekend, and we had planned to go to dinner together. 

I don’t know why she blocked me, but I’m feeling really angry about it, considering I have been there for her during many of her difficulties. She recently had been getting very demanding and asking me to give her my old iPhone for free, give rides to her coworkers, and said she’s the reason a restaurant by my house had considered hiring me.

"My(23M) social circle(22-24) and I were having a get together with another social group, we drank we ate with mingled that sort of thing. one of my friend's(Carl22M) however took interest in this quiet girl(Cindy22F) who sat quiet in the corner looking like she was afraid, Carl stared a conversation with her.

Things seemed to go smoothly till Cindy started to infodump about her favorite music preference and books, she talked for 5 mins straight before apologizing and saying she has autism. Carl just told her it's okay and mentions to her that he like that about her.

everyone stared at Carl including me because we all know Carl hates and makes fun of another person(James24M) for being autistic  to his face and behind his back. James imo is just an oddball he is wild and adventurous and just does random things for the fun, cool guy once you get to know him and not so cool guy when you're an asshole to either him or anyone close to him.

All I said in a sarcastic tone to Carl was ""Wow you hate James for being autistic but you're cool with her being on the spectrum I wanna see how this ends""

Cindy got curious asking us who James was and we explained to her everything, she laughs because some of the things we told her about James were things she also does and carl keeps complimenting her for them even though if it was James he would have burst a vein by now. Cindy then wanted to meet James because she wishes to have some friends just like her. 

We had to break the bad news that ever since Carl had gotten upset with James for his ""childish behavior"" at a mall (James just left everyone to go to the arcade and this somehow pissed off Carl) James has gone no contact from everyone thinking he is a problem so it will be hard to know where he is. Cindy didn't like that and blamed carl refusing to speak with him for the rest of the night.

" I work from home and have a spare room that I use as an office. I live with my partner who also works from home. Initially she would constantly just walk into the office to talk until I told her that had to stop.

We agreed that if the door was closed that meant I was either in a meeting of busy with work and if the door was open she could say hi but still not come in to talk.

This worked for about half a week. More recently I've had the door closed to focus on work and my gf will knock on the door, say hi and just wait there for me to respond or will come to the door and just start talking. I told her that she cant keep doing this and that we agreed that the door being closed means she isn't to disturb me. I pointed out I'm at work, it's not like I'm just ignoring her.

She said it doesn't take much to just say hi back etc and I just asked if she thinks I should stop meetings at work because she's stood outside the door waiting for me to answer her. I told her it has to stop and that if the door is closed, she is not to knock, she's just to act as if I am not in the building.

"I’m turning 20 this year. I was supposed to go uni 2022, but I had a depressive episode about having no friends and isolating so I contacted some old ones. They were  in general nice and one arranged to meet up. I decided to ghost and ignore them and use them as a safety blanket and rather not harness any effort into the friendship (admittedly I’m wrong for that). I was very sensitive about the friendship topic and was more focussed on my anxiety and feared becoming depressed like that again. I went to college for 2 years (between high skl and uni in UK). And it was horrible I started lying to my parents it was online (because of covid), so I stayed at home because I couldn’t make new friends and everyone else moved on and made some. I felt isolated and anxious around this time I reached out to therapy but was too ashamed to speak of my issues (was 17). 

I then started using my parents money on cabs where my mum would accompany me on her day off, She said at the time “how will you overcome your anxiety if you don’t face the public?”. I was proactive about getting in therapy again so I was on a 6 mo waitinglist, mum told me to tell them the full severity of mysituation . I was very much procrastinating in terms of uni here. And one day during my time living in virtually in a bubble my neighbour who is a few months older than me was going out somewhere and I asked my mum where she thought she was going and she assumed friends house maybe?. I was furious and threw a tantrum, I asked her why she assumed that knowing my situation. “She said everyone has friends to use them”. She clarified that she said I should use them as support to start uni but I was dismissive and said I’d rather start alone. My parents got bills for my spending and was angry,understandably but paid it and asked me to worry about my future. My mum said I should get a small hours job (she emphasised not for money but for my anxiety), I brushed it off.

I spent the next month constantly seeking validation for my loneliness from her and Reddit, I was told I was wrong, and being rude to my mum 95% of the time. This one time me and my brother was coming home and we saw the girl my mum assumed about and Ihad an outburst  at my brother for no reason because I was anxious. My mum later said “just because you don’t want friends doesn’t mean everyone else doesn’t either”. She mostly reassured me that I did have friends and I pushed them away and I should Move on. She quit her evening job so she can spend more time with me. 

I’ve started therapy and feel in a better headspace, like I’ve overcome the hurdle of leaving the house without my parents.  I don’t post on Reddit like that anymore . But my mum has with the help of my brother. She said she feels that she failed me and wished she took me to counselling earlier but her English isn’t good but she was always making meetings with my head of year in school whenever I was bullied and she accompanied me to my first therapy appointments after work.could be worth asking for a group session with me and mum but I'm not sure if they could accommodate that.

"I started therapy a few months ago and one of the things my therapist suggested is journaling. I didn't think it would help but I started it and find it surprisingly useful. I live with my partner and we both work from home so I find it hard to get time when I'm alone to journal so what I've been doing is sitting at the dining room table which is near our sofa and journaling there on a night. 

This means I'm in the same room as my girlfriend but we're not sat together since journaling is private and I don't want anyone else to see what I've written. My girlfriend commented that she thinks it's weird and secretive that I'll sit with my laptop angled so she can't see what I'm doing. 

I mentioned that she knows I'm doing stuff for therapy but she just repeated I'm being secretive and suspicious. She asked to see what I was doing and I just repeated that she knows it's private and that I don't want anyone else seeing it.

"

English isn't my first language so apologies for that... My daughter is not doing anything in her life at the moment she is unemployed and not in education she will turn 20 this year. Growing up she was very difficult I've had many teachers and people tell me this. She was crying to go to school and she always had difficulty of mixing with other people. She was often left out. And very sensitive I always would attend school when she was bullied to complain. She is financially reliant on both me and husband. She honestly hasn't changed in the past few years she still fries a lot and throws tantrums and has outbursts but it has sort of subsided now. I always allocate a day for her to take her around town. 

She was meant to start uni at 18. But she lied to me and her dad. That she was starting later. Here I was getting cues that she has anxiety of going there alone. She wasn't very happy with the two years she had at sixth form, infact she barely attended and took advantage that it was mostly online at the beginning and would tell us that the teachers hasn't came or it's online today. Until we had a massive meeting with the teachers about her 50% attendance. She felt alone and unable to make friends. But she did have this one friend who she went out with a few times along with other people.

I started making jokes to her that she should take our cat with her to uni, as a silly joke and she'd have a outburst about this. One day she was forcefully asking me where she thinks this girl that was a few years older than her was going (because she recollected seeing her). I said probably a friend's house and she threw a tantrum lasting months constantly seeking validation about not having friends or why I had to assume she visited her friend excetra. I told her everyone has friends. 

Now it is February and she hasn't started uni last September and I honestly kept encouraging her to start and she could make new friends but shes blaming me for belittling her and making her feel insecure and I push her over the edge , therefore she didn't start last year either. She actually started therapy late last year and is doing better slowly.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-02-03T01:50:18.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;English isn&amp;#39;t my first language so apologies for that... My daughter is not doing anything in her life at the moment she is unemployed and not in education she will turn 20 this year. Growing up she was very difficult I&amp;#39;ve had many teachers and people tell me this. She was crying to go to school and she always had difficulty of mixing with other people. She was often left out. And very sensitive I always would attend school when she was bullied to complain. She is financially reliant on both me and husband. She honestly hasn&amp;#39;t changed in the past few years she still fries a lot and throws tantrums and has outbursts but it has sort of subsided now. I always allocate a day for her to take her around town. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was meant to start uni at 18. But she lied to me and her dad. That she was starting later. Here I was getting cues that she has anxiety of going there alone. She wasn&amp;#39;t very happy with the two years she had at sixth form, infact she barely attended and took advantage that it was mostly online at the beginning and would tell us that the teachers hasn&amp;#39;t came or it&amp;#39;s online today. Until we had a massive meeting with the teachers about her 50% attendance. She felt alone and unable to make friends. But she did have this one friend who she went out with a few times along with other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started making jokes to her that she should take our cat with her to uni, as a silly joke and she&amp;#39;d have a outburst about this. One day she was forcefully asking me where she thinks this girl that was a few years older than her was going (because she recollected seeing her). I said probably a friend&amp;#39;s house and she threw a tantrum lasting months constantly seeking validation about not having friends or why I had to assume she visited her friend excetra. I told her everyone has friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is February and she hasn&amp;#39;t started uni last September and I honestly kept encouraging her to start and she could make new friends but shes blaming me for belittling her and making her feel insecure and I push her over the edge , therefore she didn&amp;#39;t start last year either.

"I  have been with my partner for 2 years. Sometime last year she was  talking about her friend who regularly looks through her boyfriends  phone and we both agreed it was an unhealthy thing to do and something  neither of us would do.

Last  weekend my girlfriend said she thinks I've been acting differently and  that she wants to look through my phone. I refused and mentioned our  previous conversation to her. I tried to get her to talk about how she  thinks I've been acting different but she refused. She said she only  wants to look through my phone once but I refused again.

The  thing is, one of my best friends has been going through some things and  he has asked me not to tell anyone. I don't want to betray his trust by  letting my gf see the messages and also I just see it as an unhealthy  thing to do.

I told my gf again  that I'm not letting her look through my phone but we can talk about why  she wants to but she refused and accused me of hiding things from her  and said it shouldn't be a problem for her to look through my phone just  this once.

"I  live with my partner and we divide chores 50/50. For the dishes we  alternate days for who does them and for cooking we used to cook  together. A couple of months ago my gf temporarily had her work pattern  changed so she started and finished later. This mean she was getting  back later so we agreed that I would cook for this period and we still  alternated the dishes.

3 weeks ago  my gfs pattern went back to normal so we said we would go back to  cooking together. I work from home but my workload has increased  recently so work has been more stressful and I've been working slightly  later. Every time it comes to food my gf will say she's tired and goes  on about how much effort everything is.

She  says she'll help and then once I've started she'll conveniently have a  nap. She's said it's because she's that tired she needs to but I pointed  out she shouldn't be getting as tired as she is each day so maybe she  should see a doctor about it but she refuses. It's started getting to me  that I'm stressed at work then expected to then go and cook for both of  us because my gf wants to go for a nap and then I still have to wash  the dishes 50% of the time.

I sat  down to talk with my gf yesterday and told her that I'd like her to  start helping more with the cooking since we agreed we'd both be doing  it and so far she hasn't helped once. She said it's not her fault she's  tired and I pointed out she only seems to be tired once cooking has  started and that if she isn't gonig to be helping with the cooking I  think she should be the one doing the dishes.

She  disagreed and said I was being unreasonable and that she does intend to  help but I just pointed out if she intended to help she wouldn't go and  lay on the sofa or bed when cooking starts. She said I was being unfair  and using her tiredness as an excuse to start an argument but I just  repeated that either she helps with the cooking or she does the dishes.

"I (M27) was at the laundromat and majority of the time, I'm alone. But that's usually expected at 6-7am on a Saturday. The few times that I have company are usually older people, like in their 50s. Then one day, I actually get someone coming in who's much younger. Like, I'd say in her early 20s. We had a normal pleasantry ""good morning"". I made her laugh by asking her ""did you just got out of bed"" because she honest to god look like it. Her hair's a mess, no make-up and she's wearing an oversized sleepshirt and pajama bottoms. I know with a lot guys, this would be a turn off. But honestly, she looked adorable.

I thought she was new in the city but she told me no, she just moved into a better place. She talked about her dog, which I was little apprehensive at first (it's a pit bull) but then she started cooing how what a huge cuddlebug it is. Like I said, this girl is cute. I didn't get much info from her. Whenever there's silence, she'd look at her phone, but everytime I would speak up she'd always engage. Told her ""I hope to see you again"".

After 2 weeks, we did. We said our ""how are you's"". And then she left after starting the washer. Now as you know, you never leave your clothes unattended at the laundromat. So I was very confused. But she did come back like a few minutes after the washer finished.

I jokingly said, ""welcome back"" and she chuckled a little. I pointed her to the sign that says about not leaving your clothes unattended. She says that it's ok, she just went grocery shopping real quick. And then I said, ""looking like that"". She didn't seem offended, and again, I like how she looked and just teasing a little. She just shrugged. And then when she started the dryer, she attempted to leave again. Said she needs to drop off her groceries at home and walk her dog. I told her she shouldn't make this a habit but again, she says it should be fine. I told her I'll stay until she comes back just so nobody takes her clothes. She said I don't have to but I honestly didn't mind.

I eventually got worried because her dryer ended like 30 minutes after she came back. By this time a few people had came in. I asked her if she's ok. She said yes she just lost track of time. I assured her nobody took her stuff. She told me ""thank you, you didn't have to do that"". I told her ""I wouldn't mind doing it again"" and ""see you later"".

3 weeks went by and I still haven't seen her. I don't know if she went to a different laundromat or she's doing her laundry on a different day or time. And I can't help but wonder if it's because of me. I guess I was hoping she'd feel the same way as I did. Being excited to see me and talk to me. I realize that sounds egocentric, but I honestly thought we had a good connection. My friends didn't think I was intimating but since I don't know her much, they thought she probably had some issues.

So, AITB? (And if said girl is maybe somehow reading this, did I do something wrong?)

"So for context, when I got in the relationship I was 17 and Jess (fake name) was 19.

I met her while I was working and we clicked pretty quickly. It was a lot of fun talking to her and walking around the building with her on my break.

I got her socials and we talked constantly by text and call. Jess was very odd but in a fun way at first. When we hung out she loved talking about her interests, no biggy, but when it came to my interests she would t really listen. She would even out right tell me it, saying this like, “yea I have no idea what you just said,” or “to be honest I wasn’t listening,” and then she’d talk about her interests, and I would listen intently. As a person with Autism my interests mean a lot to me and this was too much for me, not being able to express my love for certain things is hard- 

But that wasn’t all. Jess would make comments about my appearance. I used to be super self conscious but recently have been very happy with my look. Then on out first date she mentioned that my teeth hygiene was bad and that she wasn’t “smiling because I thought my teeth were bad.” Another time she commented on my arm hair, yes I have more than a typical afab, but I was bullied about it a lot and hated when people mentioned it. I asked her to not do that and she said ok, but brought it up again anyway. And lastly she mentioned my double chin. I don’t have a double chin but I guess I was making a silly face which made it look like I did and she just had to point it out. I was very hurt by this.

Not only that but she was very manipulative. I won’t go into detail as there’s some very personal stuff she told me, but the way she talked about it felt like she was trying to make me stay. Also they kept bringing up the fact I was almost 18 which was uncomfy.

After two weeks of knowing Jess, I broke it off with them, told them how I felt, and practically ghosted them. When they didn’t get the message I blocked them, but they emailed me one day, and then another. Then recently they dropped by my house to give me a gift. I wasn’t home so my mom got it. 

All of this has made me feel kinda bad, but still the things they were doing made me feel off. My step mom and my best friend said they felt off about Jess as well. So who knows- am I just over reacting? Or was I right to run away from this?


Extra context: I think I just really wanted to be in a relationship so I through myself at the first person who’d take me.

"Throw away account.

I wanted to write this here because I really wanted to know if I have done something wrong, even though my boyfriend and friends are telling me otherwise.

I didn't have good relationship with my family, I am the youngest child (26 years old, female). I wanted to leave my home for a long time. I managed in the end to find a job in the current country that I live and left my family house. My relationship with my parents and sisters was extremely weird and emotionally abusive, I stopped talking with one of my sister’s (sister A) years before leaving the country and then stop talking with the other one (sister B) because she broke my trust.

Before my mom passed away, I was talking with my parents by phone call or text. We didn’t talk regularly because I wanted to keep a safe distance since so many horrible things happened between us. At some point I needed to go to the doctor and after a day or two that I felt better I send a message to my mom of how things went. Then I saw that my mom was calling me a lot of times and I saw that through the phone of my mom my sister B told me it was her and she send me a message that my mom died. She told me to pick up the phone and when I did, she was screaming at me telling me that I am the reason that my mom died that from my selfish ways she died and I hope you are now happy that you won’t ever see her again. Then she closed the call and send me a picture of my mom and after this I called my dad and he told me that she died after a shower from a sudden heart attack.

After that, we decided to go back to my country for the funeral, which was the second day. Funeral day came and because I didn’t want my last memory of my momto be her in the coffin and plus if I saw my sister, I was worried that a bigger fight would have happen. I told to my dad that I wanted to come after the funeral and say my goodbyes then. He told me “What the people are going to say about you not coming?? What, aren’t you going to see your mom? It’s hard for me too but I will do it. Don’t you care about what the people are going to say about it?” even though I explain to him again that I will go to the funeral and I just didn’t want to see my mom like that. He gave his phone to my sister B and my sister was talking to me out of nowhere very sweet and pretentious as always even though she told me all this stuff two days ago. We decided for me to not be very closed to my mom’s coffin so I wouldn’t be able to see her.

We went and obviously I saw her, we went to the church and I have never felt so afraid in my whole life and alone. Thankfully my boyfriend was with me to keep me company. I was feeling like nobody wanted me there and as well my boyfriend who has done nothing, he didn’t even know them. The people that knew my family didn’t even came to me not even the kids of my sister’s or the husbands to say their condolence.

Then she closed the call and send me a picture of my mom and after this I called my dad and he told me that she died after a shower from a sudden heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we decided to go back to my country for the funeral, which was the second day. Funeral day came and because I didn’t want my last memory of my momto be her in the coffin and plus if I saw my sister, I was worried that a bigger fight would have happen. I told to my dad that I wanted to come after the funeral and say my goodbyes then. He told me “What the people are going to say about you not coming?? What, aren’t you going to see your mom? It’s hard for me too but I will do it. Don’t you care about what the people are going to say about it?” even though I explain to him again that I will go to the funeral and I just didn’t want to see my mom like that. He gave his phone to my sister B and my sister was talking to me out of nowhere very sweet and pretentious as always even though she told me all this stuff two days ago. We decided for me to not be very closed to my mom’s coffin so I wouldn’t be able to see her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went and obviously I saw her, we went to the church and I have never felt so afraid in my whole life and alone. Thankfully my boyfriend was with me to keep me company. I was feeling like nobody wanted me there and as well my boyfriend who has done nothing, he didn’t even know them. The people that knew my family didn’t even came to me not even the kids of my sister’s or the husbands to say their condolence.&lt;br/&gt;
To be continue..&lt;/p&gt;

"I have had 3 exams this week through work. My lasty one is tomorrow morning and to celebrate finishing them I had booked a table at my favourite restaurant in town and then some cocktails bars afterwards for me and my girlfriend. We also have the cinema booked for Saturday and a day out on Sunday.

My girlfriend got a message from one of her friends saying she's going to be home for the weekend and asked if my girlfriend wanted to meet up. She suggested Friday to my girlfriend. My girlfriend mentioned this to me and apologised but said she doesn't know when she's going to see this friend next so she doesn't want to say no.

I mentioned suggesting the next day since we had no plans during the day on Saturday and I wouldn't mind cancelling the cinema if we had to but I didn't really want to cancel Friday since I've been looking forward to it for weeks.

My girlfriend said she was really looking forward to the cinema so doesn't want to cancel it, especially since we've bought tickets already. I told her I didn't really want to cancel Friday since it was supposed to be a celebration.

She said she doesn't have a choice but I just pointed out she has multiple alternatives but she refuses to even consider them. She accused me of not being understanding but I just pointed out she didn't give me a second thought as soon as something else came up.

She said I was being too harsh towards her and that I'm not being fair but I just pointed out that she knew how much I was looking forward to Friday night and yet she still didn't hesitate to cancel as soon as someone else wanted to meet up.

"I  have a range of hobbies from reading, being outfoors and going on  walks, going to the gym and playing video games. Working full time and  being in a relationship means I don't get a lot of time to do most of  them. My partner and I go to the gym together so that works quite well,  we go for walks throughout the summer when we can but my partner doesn't  like being outside in the cold so we don't really go for walks together  in the winter months and I manage to read on a night.

The  one hobby I don't really get a lot of time for is playing video games. I  play them for a maximum of 30 mins every few days when I get the time  but it can be hard when my girlfriend wants to watch something on tv for  example.

We both have 2 days  annual leave left to take before April. We already have a few things  planned before then that we've already put leave in for so I thought I  could use the 2 days left to just take a long weekend and relax and  catch up on hobbies.

I told my  girlfriend what I was thinking about doing and she said she thought we  could do something together. I pointed out all of the plans we have  coming up but she just said I should want to use my leave to do things  with her and that I am prioritising video games.

I  mentioned that I never really get time to play anymore so it would be  nice to have a couple of chilled out days where I can relax in the  apartment. I said if she doesn't want to do that then I'd understand if  she wants to make plans with family or friends when she chooses to take  her leave.

She disagreed and said  we should be spending the time together and that she wanted to make  plans. She said that I'm prioritising video games over the  relationship. I told her that's not what I was doing at all and that if I  was prioritising video games I'd have used the majority of the time off  for them but I haven't.

She just  said that I should be spending my time off with her and not planning to  use my last few days of leave playing video games.

"I  have been with my partner for 3 and a half years. I have started noticing a lot  of the effort and nice gestures seems to come from my side. This came to  a head last week. My girlfriend graduated from university so to  celebrate we went out for a meal. I had already brought her a little  gift to celebrate but I also paid for the meal and drinks.

I  then finished my professional exams last week and mentioned going out  for food to celebrate. We got to the restaurant and when we were looking  at the menu my girlfriend asked if I was paying. I mentioned that I  thought she might have wanted to pay as a treat for me for finishing my  exams but if not then we can split 50/50.

She  said since it was my suggestion to go out then I should be paying. This  upset me slightly since I had gone out of my way to celebrate her  graduating and she did nothing for me. Later that night I mentioned to  her that things seem very one sided and that I can't think of the last  time she did something nice for me or treated me etc and that it always  seems like me doing things for her.

She  said I was wrong but couldn't actually give any examples. She said I  was starting an argument for nothing and that I'm making her out to be a  bad guy for no reason.

I just  pointed out that in relationships it's nice to do something for the  other person but she doesn't seem to do that. She accused me of guilt  tripping and manipulating her to make her feel bad which I disagreed  with. She said I was being completely unfair and unreasonable.

"My girlfriend and I's birthdays are both in the same month which is February. We usually have either a weekend away in-between both birthdays or a day out each. This year we agreed on a day out each since we have less money  next month due to paying for a holiday in May. 

I picked the place I wanted to go for the day out for my birthday and made plans on what I wanted to do while there. Last night my girlfriend mentioned she was thinking we could do a weekend away for her birthday. I mentioned out previous agreement and reminded her that money will be tight next month. 

She said we could still do the day out for mine and then when it comes to hers we could stretch to two nights away. I disagreed because of money and because of the fact it's not really fair for her to get a full weekend away when I just get a day. 

I mentioned two nights away will not likely be affordable so we will just do a day out but she said no and thinks I should be fine with her getting a weekend away. I just said if she wants a weekend away then she can pay for it herself but she said I was being unfair. 

I just repeated again that we'd agreed on a day out and that a weekend away is unaffordable.

"AMITA. I have 2 Roomates that I meet on facebook. (First mistake) I moved in with practically nothing building up due to a new job and moving in a rush. Context they both are white with a dog, and I’m black. Let’s call them Ryan and Olivia  Not trying to make it a race thing 
The first flag was after the first night they went into my room when I went in for my job orientation. They said the dog went into the room and they went to get him. Weird, but ok. They asked if I needed help due to me not having any furniture. I slept on the floor the first night so. It’s the first night

2nd Flag. I brought groceries for myself and Ryan ate literally 90% of my snacks. I brushed it off.

3rd Red flag. The dog. The dog constantly barks especially when I get ready to go to sleep for work since I work 12 hr weekend shifts. They just let him bark literally all night they’ve asked me to feed him let him out, but I do to be a good Roomate.

4th red flag: Lying to the government. They both applied for food stamps when they both have an inheritance and take more flights than the city girls. Ryan lied to them and got them so did Olivia.

The last flag was Ryan makes direct digs at black people. Like he said why do black businesses get a week to be when if it was white businesses did it it’ll be a problem. He also mentioned women working isn’t really needed they don’t anything.

Update: They made a bathroom rules list and which one I agree with. I used the bathroom and accidentally pooped on the bidet. He texted about it but I cleaned it.

I (18m) have autistim and a dissability that affects my joints making me use a cane. I am very able to do my job, I work in a cafe in the kitchen and make coffees. We got a new co-worker 'Meg', meg is older than me I'd say 40.

Meg was nice and polite at first, talking to me normally and only asked one question about my cane. But as soon as she found out I was autistic she began to talk to me like I was a child asking me things like ""would you be ok on till by yourself?"" And ""are you sure you can make that latte without hurting your hands?"" All in a 'Im talking to a young child or dog' voice. She even told co-workers not to swear around me because 'innocent ears'. None of my co-workers treat me any different and on multiple occasions asked her to stop.

I have asked her to stop many times, I have even proved to her that I am very capable and I have worked there for 3 years, longer than most co-workers but she just wouldn't stop. 

I had had enough and in a chat to our manager brought up how annoying it was. He didn't realize she was doing this and called her in for a meeting, where I heard him raise his voice, she had shouted first. This made sense in my mind as he has had to defend me before. She came out crying and want home.

This is the second strike on her record despite only being here for 4 months and if she messes up again she'll be let go. She had found comfort in one of our bar staff and told him everything, he came to me and called me a b-hole because she has kids and animals to take care of and can't afford to loose another job. I've told a few people about this for advice and things and a few have told me I'm a b-face because I couldn't have asked her to stop and not gone to my manager but in my defense I didn't formally report it, it just came up in a chat with him and he took it seriously.

" Using my cousin's reddit (with his permission) for privacy reasons. 

So I (26M) work an office job and my wife (27F) is a restauranteur with my BIL, and my MIL (57F) watches our baby (0.5M). My MIL is our *de facto* babysitter; she was unemployed otherwise.

Normally, I get home late (7:00PM) and I don't get around to changing out of my office clothes until 9:00PM.

Today, I got into work early and left early and got lucky by catching the early train and got dropped off around 5:45. My plan was to pick up the baby at my MIL's house and go home. Because I had time, I decided to go home first, change clothes and then go get the baby. The action of changing my clothes took 60 seconds total (I timed it.)

My MIL saw that I was in comfortable clothes and told my wife about how I went home and got changed. My wife then berated me saying that I am not allowed to get changed when someone's watching my kids and is waiting for me to get home.

I knew she was waiting, and I know she has a finite amount of patience/energy allocated towards watching the baby, which was why I made it a point to speedrun the change of clothes process, even when I had a time surplus of close to an hour. I didn't bother communicating to my wife or my MIL saying ""I want to change my clothes"" because I didn't think it was going to make a difference considering I was an hour ahead of schedule.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-30T19:08:03.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using my cousin&amp;#39;s reddit (with his permission) for privacy reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I got into work early and left early and got lucky by catching the early train and got dropped off around 5:45. My plan was to pick up the baby at my MIL&amp;#39;s house and go home. Because I had time, I decided to go home first, change clothes and then go get the baby. The action of changing my clothes took 60 seconds total (I timed it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My MIL saw that I was in comfortable clothes and told my wife about how I went home and got changed. My wife then berated me saying that I am not allowed to get changed when someone&amp;#39;s watching my kids and is waiting for me to get home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew she was waiting, and I know she has a finite amount of patience/energy allocated towards watching the baby, which was why I made it a point to speedrun the change of clothes process, even when I had a time surplus of close to an hour. I didn&amp;#39;t bother communicating to my wife or my MIL saying &amp;quot;I want to change my clothes&amp;quot; because I didn&amp;#39;t think it was going to make a difference considering I was an hour ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

"Hey everyone!

I posted on this subreddit a few days ago regarding my friend B.  To break it down, B has repeatedly disrupted my student worker job as well as other things such as:
 - Peer pressuring me into going to their party by chasing me down at work &amp; not allowing me to work until I said yes
- Loudly asked about my medication &amp; why I take it, in front of a lot of students while I was working at an event (just had the bottle in my hand, preparing to go to a different room) 
- Blocking my wheelchair insisting that I needed help when I answered that I didn’t &amp; thank you for offering.

Short version but the gist for those seeing this one.  

After taking some of the advice on here, I have decided to explain my boundaries to B &amp; also inform B that if these continue, I’d have to inform my supervisor as it is disrupting my work. 

B’s response has made me consider not wanting to invite B to my grad party.  I’ll explain.  After I sent those messages (about 3-4 at most), B read the messages, ignored everything that I said &amp; then tried following my social media account again (it’s private &amp; I don’t feel comfortable right now).

Well just recently I am beginning to send out my grad party invites for my graduation in May.  However while I was trying to plan out the invite list, I immediately thought of not inviting B.  I have my reasons  from those above &amp; including that whenever I talk to anyone that’s a student (never staff or faculty), B comes up, acts like they don’t exist &amp; interrupts.

Though I don’t think it feels right to exclude B…but I also want to be able to enjoy my graduation party.  

My senior year has been extremely rough as I’ve had medical testing, got diagnosed with a severe chronic illness called POTS, &amp; now am getting testing for other things that are going on.  Not including fighting for my proper accommodations as well as leaving school for 2 months &amp; having to teach myself 5 classes, still passed which matters though. 

It’s safe to say that I am not really in a place to go back &amp; forth as well as play games with anyone in general.  Plus graduating is a huge milestone for me &amp; I don’t want B to interrupt any of my other friends that make time out of their schedules to be there (which I truly appreciate).

Is there another way to go about this instead of just flat out nothing inviting B?  

I’m just stuck on what to do.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-30T04:48:07.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

"She(23f) moved out this past weekend and got the majority of her things. I(30f) was really upset that she gave a little more than 30 days notice, because I had spoken to her numerous times about my past horrible roommate experiences. My last roommate gave me 4 months and she said she would do the same but lied. She paid for February but still. 

Anyway she came by the other night to grab some stuff and closed the door hard as she left. I hate door slams like that because loud sounds have traumatized me. 

I go out to the door and yank it open and yell at her that she doesn’t need to slam it like that. She looked really surprised but also kind of disgusted when she told me she didn’t even slam it. But she did. 

I then slam the door in her face to show her how it feels and she calls me a crazy b*tch.

"This is an online friend, so might change perspectives.  He and I would play games together and text from 2020-23.  He had a lot of double standards I started noticing.  He could take a while to reply, but if I did I was ignoring him.  He could get mad at the game, but if I did I was killing the vibe.  He could not text much during the game, but if I did I was making things awkward.

One time, he sent me a long message and it was overwhelming so I took a bit to reply.  A friend in a group chat sent a meme which I quickly reacted to.  He was upset I replied there first instead of his message.  I understood why he was upset and apologized for making him feel ignored.  I told him I would be fair and timely with my replies in the future.

Fast forward to a month later:  I'm sleeping earlier because I'm tired from school and work.  Two nights in a row he asks me to play when I'm asleep, I text him as soon as I wake up to say ""sorry dude I was sleeping, we'll try again tomorrow."".  Then when I am awake later in the week, I ask him to play.  No reply.  The next day I ask him again.  Still no reply.  Then the third day he texts our friend in the group chat we're both in.

So I hit him up like ""hey man, I've been noticing a lot of double standards in our friendship.  I don't think it's fair to get mad at me for stuff then do it yourself.  I'm not sure if you're upset at me not replying this week, but I can't reply in my sleep.  Can we talk about this?""

And he proceeds to not listen to me at all and go off on me about how it's completely different and I was ignoring him all week so he doesn't have to reply to me timely.  I told him I replied as soon as I woke up but he said it didn't matter, time still passed.  He said I was crazy for getting upset about this.  (Something my manipulative parents did often was make a reasonable thing to get upset about seem like a crazy, insane thing to be upset about.  It really reminded me of this.)

"I (24M) have been in a long-distance relationship with an older woman in America (34F) for several years now and have been wanting her to visit me in New Zealand for a long time. I finally got my wish two weeks ago, and I've never been happier. Unfortunately, she has to return to America tomorrow. Or she would have to, if I hadn't executed a brilliant plan. 

I wrote heartfelt letters to Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-Un explaining how important my relationship with this woman was to me, and expressed fears that I may never see her again once she leaves. So I had a simple request for them, which they fulfilled: I notified them a couple of days ago that my girlfriend was in New Zealand, and like they promised, America (and the entire Northern Hemisphere) has now been destroyed in a nuclear war, meaning my girlfriend never has to (and can't) return home, and she can stay with me forever!

My girlfriend was crying about how her entire family and all of her friends are now dead. In order to comfort her, I revealed to her, with evidence, that I orchestrated World War 3 so we could be together forever, and that the death of billions was a terrible but necessary consequence of our eternal love.

Long story short, she broke up with me and I'm now in hospital with severe injuries. Additionally, I am being charged with countless international war crimes. Why does the world not accept true love? What's more loving than sacrificing most of the world's population for the love of your life?

"My (39M) wife (39F) got a late Autism diagnosis about a 2 years ago. Since then it's been a steady decline in behavior. House tasks have fallen pretty much solely to me now, hygiene has fallen to concerning lows with the reasoning said being that the shower/tub feels a certain way, tics have become way more apparent and damaging (her arms are wrecked from picking), and lately she rarely shows up to work but is in a position that she can't be fired from. 

Physical intimacy has been absent for about three years now in both sex and just general touches like a hug for no reason or an arm touch in passing. I do what I can to keep things clean around the house but tbh fail sometimes as I have my own job and tasks.

"(With big update) AITBF for blowing up at my sister when she asked me for help yet again. 
So my sister(24) who is younger by a year and a half, will only ever talk to me when she needs help or needs something. Ie she calls when she needs money, help moving, my credit card, using my parking, booking things, ect. So last week, and my sister called me to ask to borrow my credit card. She was at a hotel in another city and the hotel wouldn’t give her the room, even though she paid for it because she only has a prepaid card, they need a credit card on file. I blew up at her that she only ever talks to me when she needs something and can’t even be bothered to ask me how I’m doing even once in the past two years. And then I brought up the fact that she forgot to even wish me a happy birthday this year even though I knew she knew it was my birthday( I made a snap about my birthday and she had seen it). And I also mentioned that when it was her birthday this year that I had wished her a happy birthday and she didn’t even reply( her birthday is after mine). She called our mom to complain about me not wanting to help and my mom called me mad that I didn’t help my sister out “because she’s your sister and you always help out family”. This wasn’t out of the norm. Our mom always takes my sisters side with anything and everything. 
So. Am I the Buttface?

Big update 

So my mom and my sister have decided that this was the hill they were gonna die on. My mom has stopped me from seeing my brother and so because of that I went to a lawyer to see what I could do. My dad is also upset with my mom and has had enough of her so he is divorcing her. My sister has started an online campaign against me saying I’m a terrible person and how I refuse to help her and all that saying I’m splitting up the family. My dad is gonna help me fight to get guardianship for my brother (he’s disabled and can never work) over my mother cuz she’s unstable and has had multiple mental breakdowns. 
I’m upset with how everything turned out. But I figure that if I just let them talk their bs and do their little circus that people will realize what I’ve been dealing with.  I’m not sure if I’ll update again but we will see.

"I went out for a drink with my girlfriend and a friend of mine last night. My friend was talking about how he hasn't been getting many matches on dating apps so my girlfriend asked him to show us his profile and she would give him some tips on what girls might look for and how to improve his profile. 

While we did that he swiped on a few people and we noticed the girlfriend of a friend of mine was on the app. There were recent photos so it's not an old account. I asked him to screenshot the profile and send it to me since I thought my friend deserved to know. He did that and then swiped on her and he matched. 

My girlfriend said we should stay out of it but I just said that if she was on tinder then I'd want someone to let me know and I can't just hide this from my friend. I sent him the screenshots and my girlfriend said I was interfering in something that was none of my business but I just repeated I couldn't hide the fact my friends girlfriend is cheating on him or at least trying to cheat

She just said that I'm causing drama for no reason but I just pointed out she'd likely want to know if it was me on the apps and that it's the right thing to do.

&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend said we should stay out of it but I just said that if she was on tinder then I&amp;#39;d want someone to let me know and I can&amp;#39;t just hide this from my friend. I sent him the screenshots and my girlfriend said I was interfering in something that was none of my business but I just repeated I couldn&amp;#39;t hide the fact my friends girlfriend is cheating on him or at least trying to cheat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just said that I&amp;#39;m causing drama for no reason but I just pointed out she&amp;#39;d likely want to know if it was me on the apps and that it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AITA for sending the screenshots to my friend?&lt;/p&gt;

"I (70M) have been spending the last four years building a biological preserve on an island off the coast of Costa Rica.

So yesterday was a weirdly warm day and I was going to spend the day with my bf outside. We hit up a few breweries, got lunch, and walked around the park. I was wearing a skirt that was slightly above my knee and a cute top. 

While walking around the park the wind started picking up and my skirt blew up briefly. I tried to hold it down in the front but the rear would blow around a bit. My bf noticed, and also noticed that a couple guys behind us could have seen. He says they did but has no proof. This happened a couple other times on our 30+ min walk. 

I was wearing undies (thong if that matters). But he said I should have known it was going to be windy. Or worn shorts under “such a short skirt”. 

I think it’s nbd even if the guys behind me saw some cheeks. But he’s making it seem like I did it intentionally and wanted to flash them. He’s basically calling me an ah for “not respecting our relationship”.

"To add context, she has done a piece of an edible when we were long distance and she was acting crazy, I didn't know why and she didn't tell me until days or weeks later. Now we have been together for over 4 years and she knows I'm strongly opposed to drugs due to family history and so many people's lives being ruined due to them, and she decides to not only buy some edibles, but she proceeds to take 100 mg of one of them even though the so-called friend/coworker she was with recommended her not to but only to take a bite. She had a bad trip and had to be escorted home by this co-worker! I was at work and when I got back home she was laying down saying she was in pain and her head was hurting, I didn't know what to make of it because she is always going through something. I just wanted to get home and do our nightly routine of watching our show, and she couldn't even do that it was so bad. I was there for her that night and I asked her what was really going on and what we can do about it, she proceeds to zone out and then go back into the room. 

I just found out last night after like 2 weeks because she came clean about doing the edible. Now me and her have discussed the fact that I am strongly opposed to drugs, especially in young people before the age of 25 or 26 due to the frontal lobe development and neuroplasticity. This feels like a huge breach of trust not only because she didn't tell me until way later and after we had sex, but because I wasn't even there with her and she lied to me right to my face.

This is really like the 1 millionth straw for me, as I have been really trying for her, and it sucks because I didn't really even freak out and I was very supportive when she told me, but now I'm really having second thoughts because I already made it clear that I don't want to be with a drug user. I have never done one because I have no need for that sort of thing. If other people want to do that more power to them, but I would rather not be around that as I have been around it my whole life. She already has addictive traits with a lot of things and I really don't want to be here if she goes down that path.
Now and I think about y'all, she's actually been love bombing me ever since. And not that I should even need to add this, but the reason I'm so strongly opposed to drug use of that sort is that my sister is schizophrenic, my aunt is schizophrenic, my cousin is schizophrenic, and one thing linked them all, they got a bad batch of marijuana one night and have never been the same since. My girlfriend knows this and still decided to do the same thing they all decided to do and could have ended up the same way... I guess that's what really hurts about the whole thing as well.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of over 4 years has breached my trust by doing edibles twice without me being around and I'm strongly opposed to drug use. I made this clear and she still decided to do this. She had bad trips both times and didn't tell me until way later.

"Update of : [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/18vh6x8/aitb\_for\_being\_mad\_at\_my\_mum\_for\_cancelling\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/18vh6x8/aitb_for_being_mad_at_my_mum_for_cancelling_my/)

I might go to Alice and Tom's camp. It's only that I've started to get terribly scared of it. Ellie, who was mentioned in a previous post, goes to these camps every month because she has a son who, like me, has cerebral palsy (Lucas,M29).

To clarify. Since Alice and Tom moved out I have never mentioned a word about them to my mum. Also, I have never mentioned wanting to go to their camp. Each time it was Mum's idea.

A week ago she said she wanted to try again. Preferably as soon as possible.

I felt a bit confused. On the one hand I really want to go there and on the other hand I'm afraid that everything will end up as usual and I'll have to pay money for the booking cancellation.

This time my mum has planned the trip much better. She wants us to rent a flat together with Ella and Lucas for the time of the camp. We would drive to the camp area together with Ella in her car. Mum also said that this would only be for the first time, then for the next camps mum would travel by her car. I don't believe this a bit, because Mum is afraid to drive outside our small town or even when it rains. 

As I said, on the one hand I'm very happy, but on the other hand I'm very worried about whether it will all work out. I am most afraid of the boss. She seems to be a woman of tough rules. So I texted Alice, even though I know that she and Tom are both on a physiotherapy course. She told me that because I had canceled booked twice I would have to pay for the next one before the camp.

I found out from Alice that unfortunately all of her and Tom's therapy hours are booked until the end of 2024. However, they have recently hired a new physiotherapist (Jacob,M24) Apparently Alice and Tom chose him themselves and sent him on a course in the same method Alice and Tom are using. Of course, I regret that I won't be able to have a PT with Alice and Tom, but since Jacob is good I may give it a try. Alice instructed me to direct further questions to the boss.

 With a pounding heart I asked her about the Lucas camps schedule. It was on a Wednesday evening. She probably replied a long time ago, but I am afraid to read the email. In a flush of panic I'm starting to wonder whether to start pretending I don't want to go, on the other hand I want to go there.

I think I'm being a bit of a coward.

"So for context, my roommate and I are both in the same major and have multiple classes together. But he is kind of a slacker and doesn’t do well academically as I do. I know that because last semester he complained a lot about his grades, which were often lower than mine. Throughout last semester and the beginning of the current semester, I haven’t really seen him in the room. I would assume that he’s out partying or going off on excursions. I, on the other hand, typically spend my week doing homework and studying - or watching movies. It’s obvious that he and I are two very different people, lol. During the times when I do see him, he often asks me to help him with the homework. Thanks to me, he does well on the homework but flunks all the exams because yes, you guessed it: he doesn’t study for them.

So, to get to the point: about a few hours ago, I finished all my homework for the week and decide to watch a movie before going to bed. As I’m nearing the end of the movie, my roommate returns home and sits down at his desk. He asks me if I finished my homework yet and I told him yes, and then he asked if I could help him with it. I told him that I didn’t feel like it. He asked me why and said that since I finished it, it should be easy since I know all the answers and we can get it over with. I got annoyed and said that he should figure it out on his own. He got annoyed as well and demanded why I had to make things difficult. And that’s when I launched into a long-winded rant:

“Hey man, you had this coming to you. You don’t realize that getting 100s on the homework isn’t enough to pass classes? The exams affect your grade much more! You had several opportunities to improve last semester and dismissed all of them, and it seems like you’re going to repeat that this semester. Why should I waste my time helping someone who won’t even help himself? And just to be clear, you’re not even entitled to my help. With the way you are now, you’re going to fail the classes and waste your parent’s money, and that’s not going to be my problem. I suggest that you ether get your shit together or drop out, because I’m not going to help you with homework anymore, period.”

He got real quiet when I finished talking. I assumed he wasn’t expecting me to rant to him like that, but at the time I thought it was necessary because he was starting to get on my nerves. I assumed he was done talking and went back to watching my movie. He turned off his light and went to bed without another word.

It’s almost 5:30 AM where I am and I’m still awake because I’ve been heavily debating if I crossed a line or not with what I said. I don’t know if I should apologize to him or not, because while I acknowledge that I may have been a bit harsh, I also feel that he deserved that harshness given the circumstances. I was honestly just frustrated that he wasn’t learning from his mistakes.

"There’s going to be a lot of context and I’m on mobile so forgive me. 

So I (26F) used to work at my local coffee shop for about two years. A year into it me and another coworker ‘Ashley’ (24F) began dating and I left the shop a few weeks later for unrelated reasons (wanted to focus on getting my teaching credential.) It was casual because she has a long term partner she’s been seeing for six years and they both wanted to try polyamory/opening the relationship, I’ve never done it but said I was open to it. So I dated her, not her partner but we were friends. Our coworkers also knew we were dating. 

Long story short we dated for four months and she began to say she was falling in love with me. She would get upset if I wouldn’t come to her place to help set up/cook for parties or take care of her if she was ill/had a UTI (despite living with her long term partner who could do that.) We broke up when she came over to my place unannounced and me and her had a talk and she admitted she wanted more and I said I couldn’t give that to her. I assumed it was mutual but one of our mutual coworkers 23F ‘Jan’ inserted herself and texted me saying I was awful and a “queerbaiter” I’m not, I’ve been proudly bisexual since I was 15.

 I blocked Jan after saying this relationship didn’t involve her and I was hurt she even chose sides because I was under the assumption we were all friends. 

Ashley is letting Jan and her girlfriend (also 23F) stay at her place now since they got kicked out of their last residence. I had been visiting the coffee shop regularly since it’s walking distance from my home and I got a gift card for Christmas along with an ex employee discount. Thankfully I don’t run into my ex that much and the roommate rarely, I say hello to everyone and tip/catch up. No one has a set schedule so I’m never sure who’s working what day. 

Anyways, today me and a friend (26M) went there since we were going downtown to shop. When I got there, Jan made our drinks badly on purpose and confronted me, saying I “have a lot of nerve to show my face and that I should be ashamed of myself considering how heartbroken Ashley still is.” My friend said she sounded insane, as had everyone else I’ve asked. But I wanted to ask an unbiased group. Am I the Buttface for still going to that coffee shop? It’s been almost three months since we’ve broken up over what I assumed was a casual 4 month open relationship.

Edit: I realized I phrased the timing odd. I was a year into working there when Ashley got hired. We were friends first, then by the end of the two years I was there, we dated for a few weeks as coworkers and then it continued for four months after I left. ","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-28T04:27:25.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s going to be a lot of context and I’m on mobile so forgive me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I (26F) used to work at my local coffee shop for about two years. A year into it me and another coworker ‘Ashley’ (24F) began dating and I left the shop a few weeks later for unrelated reasons (wanted to focus on getting my teaching credential.) It was casual because she has a long term partner she’s been seeing for six years and they both wanted to try polyamory/opening the relationship, I’ve never done it but said I was open to it. So I dated her, not her partner but we were friends. Our coworkers also knew we were dating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short we dated for four months and she began to say she was falling in love with me. She would get upset if I wouldn’t come to her place to help set up/cook for parties or take care of her if she was ill/had a UTI (despite living with her long term partner who could do that.) We broke up when she came over to my place unannounced and me and her had a talk and she admitted she wanted more and I said I couldn’t give that to her. I assumed it was mutual but one of our mutual coworkers 23F ‘Jan’ inserted herself and texted me saying I was awful and a “queerbaiter” I’m not, I’ve been proudly bisexual since I was 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blocked Jan after saying this relationship didn’t involve her and I was hurt she even chose sides because I was under the assumption we were all friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley is letting Jan and her girlfriend (also 23F) stay at her place now since they got kicked out of their last residence. I had been visiting the coffee shop regularly since it’s walking distance from my home and I got a gift card for Christmas along with an ex employee discount. Thankfully I don’t run into my ex that much and the roommate rarely, I say hello to everyone and tip/catch up. No one has a set schedule so I’m never sure who’s working what day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, today me and a friend (26M) went there since we were going downtown to shop. When I got there, Jan made our drinks badly on purpose and confronted me, saying I “have a lot of nerve to show my face and that I should be ashamed of myself considering how heartbroken Ashley still is.” My friend said she sounded insane, as had everyone else I’ve asked. But I wanted to ask an unbiased group. Am I the Buttface for still going to that coffee shop? It’s been almost three months since we’ve broken up over what I assumed was a casual 4 month open relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

"So I (30m) was dating 28f. We used to live 1 city apart, in texas. Then I got a new job where I'd be traveling, and the home office would also be in a different city and state I'd have to move to (florida). It was literally my dream job, and was so much better than the job I had before. She and I talked about the new job, and being that it was a fairly new relationship, I wouldn't say her and I were ""serious."" I mean, I was serious about trying to make things work between us, but it just feels weird to call it serious that quickly (we hadn't even been dating a year, in fact we were only reaching 4 months).

We decided to take a step back and try to think things through apart, but this job meant everything to me, and would make for a better life for me, and for us if she decided to be with me. She, understandably, wanted to continue finishing grad school and staying in her career, but in the same town.

So, we went our separate ways, but stayed in touch. At one point, my work sent me to a fairly small town in upstate new york. My gf said she wanted to visit me, and I gave her the city where I'd be at. Well, she wound up going to New York City, and not to where I was. She then got upset at me because I was unable to meet her there. The thing is, my work provides us a rental to be shared by employees only and monitors how much we use the car, and basically, I'm not allowed to have a car more than 2 hours. Not to mention I'm also actually working the days she visited. (Maybe she thought I didn't work weekends?) 

She got very upset and we argued about and I explained I am not risking the greatest job I ever had, particularly when I never agreed to travel to New York city.  It feels like to me she had a vacation planned for herself, and expected me to join without considering my responsibilities or limitations, or bothering to communicate any of her expectations in traveling.

"For context: It's a semi-detached house where both households rent out the bottom apartment. So my landlord is different to theirs, even though we technically live wall to wall. The road leads to the upper apatments because its a hill, so the bottom apartments have a staircase down on each side to our entrance, where there is a big shared garden.

Also, me(24m) and my GF(22f) have a really good relationship with our landlord and their neighbour upstairs, we even have their phone number incase our landlord is away and we need anything.

Our neighbour downstairs however, is very distant. She is a woman in her 30s and barely nods when we say ""hello!"" when we see each other in the driveway. Which is totally fine btw, never had a problem with her and she never makes noise.

However, yesterday she had her mother(i suppose) and a female friend/sibling/relative over for visit. Where they had brought their dog with them and let it run freely outside. We didn't know of this until our two cats came running back inside through our front porch door, which we have open slightly so the cats can go in and out, and in the gap was the dog barking and trying to enter our house through the gap in the door, but luckily the gap wasn't big enough and we scared it away.

We contacted our landlord first and she literally said, try to talk to them or call the cops (quite extreme that one).

While talking to her, we saw the dog ***(AGAIN)*** outside our office window taking a shit there.

We then went over to our neighbours and questioned them politely why they let the dog run freely and if they could keep it in a leash or inside. In which we only got met with a sigh and a chuckle from the mother and the relative saying in a confrontational tone *""its friendly and only wanted to play with the cats""*.

This resulted in us getting quite mad and decided to just leave and call the tenants landlord complaining about the situation which ultimately ended with them calling her, telling her she needed to kick them out because dogs are not allowed in the apartment and gave her a warning for letting it run outside causing us trouble.

It might have damaged our relationship with the tenant/our neighbour, and she didnt even say anything when we went over, it was her guests that took the freedom to talk and do as they pleased. So I feel a little bad for her but I also feel she should've taken more responsibility. AITB?

TLDR: I(24m) complained to our neighbours landlord for letting their guests dog run loose in our shared garden and chase me and my gfs(22) cats while trying to enter our apartment, in which resulted in her getting a talking to (possible written warning) and her guests/family thrown out.

"UPDATE: I talked to him after I posted this. He said he’ll be more mindful about the shared items in the future… but I’ll also take your suggestions and put it on a separate plate! Thanks everyone!!

—-

We got take out/delivery for dinner (I paid.) We ordered from a local burger joint that we both really like. The combo came with 1 double cheeseburger, 1 single cheeseburger, 1 XL poutine, 1 dessert and 2 drinks. While ordering, I asked if there was anything else he’d like to add. He said no, and he thinks that’s more than enough.

He had the double, and I had the single. Poutine and dessert to be shared. Before he even took a bite out of his burger, he ate 1/3 of the poutine. I had one bite of the poutine at this point. 

He finishes his burger, and starts eating the poutine quickly. He ate the poutine so fast, that I probably had a total of 10-15 fries. He finally stopped when there was one cheese curd/fry left and asked if I wanted it. I was annoyed at this point and said no.

I love fries, and he knows this. This isn’t the first time he pretty much ate everything and didn’t stop to share. Sometimes it honestly feels like I have to eat quickly or else I won’t get to eat any.

"AITA wouldn’t let me post so trying here if that’s ok 😊

I am a student who is a student worker: student leader &amp; also chronically ill so I use a wheelchair with limited walking use of canes (applies to the story).

I have this friend named B who I met about a year ago, B &amp; I were good friends for a while.  However this all started in June when I was working during the Summer.  B was planning a party &amp; peer pressured me into going when I wasn’t sure, then basically ditched me when I was there.  

Fast forward a bit cause school started, got ill, got diagnosed with a severe case of a  chronic illness &amp; still trying to get answers…also I had to leave school for 2 months due to my new chronic disability along with getting a wheelchair.

B has seen that I’ve gotten back to school, only for work though bc I can’t go to classes in person without becoming ill (flashing lights &amp; projector light is why).

Well B has been more clingy.  B has interrupted multiple times when I’ve been talking to students while I’m working, B even saw my prescription medication bottle, asking me really loud in the middle of a quiet event that I was working about it to the point where multiple students stared at me &amp; now knew that I take medication for a medical condition.

&lt;p&gt;I am a student who is a student worker: student leader &amp;amp; also chronically ill so I use a wheelchair with limited walking use of canes (applies to the story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have this friend named B who I met about a year ago, B &amp;amp; I were good friends for a while.  However this all started in June when I was working during the Summer.  B was planning a party &amp;amp; peer pressured me into going when I wasn’t sure, then basically ditched me when I was there.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a bit cause school started, got ill, got diagnosed with a severe case of a  chronic illness &amp;amp; still trying to get answers…also I had to leave school for 2 months due to my new chronic disability along with getting a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B has seen that I’ve gotten back to school, only for work though bc I can’t go to classes in person without becoming ill (flashing lights &amp;amp; projector light is why).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well B has been more clingy.  B has interrupted multiple times when I’ve been talking to students while I’m working, B even saw my prescription medication bottle, asking me really loud in the middle of a quiet event that I was working about it to the point where multiple students stared at me &amp;amp; now knew that I take medication for a medical condition.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel constricted in this friendship &amp;amp; with my responsibilities as well as dealing with my complex medical health, I’m just really tired &amp;amp; I don’t feel comfortable continuing this friendship.  I’m worried it may cause issues but I also don’t think I should keep dealing with this either.&lt;/p&gt;

"So, my ex dumped me 3 months ago. I'm heart broken, together for 3 years. He mentioned he's seeing someone else (happened a month ago) and wants to have them over when we have opposite schedules. I started seeing a rebound just to satisfy some needs and he started asking a LOT more often of what my schedule was to have her over. 

On the logical side, sure fine whatever. But I'm HURT. This guy has just broken up with me after 3 years and moving states away with him. I don't want to hear about it. It hurts so much I just want it to stop. I want to act like everything is normal at home as far as my routine, and not have to think about another person's schedule in my place 3-5 times a week. He texts me in the middle of the work day even when he's at work, asking me if I'm going to be home at my normal time (I get off 2 hours later than him). I don't want to ask anything unreasonable, but asking him to be sensitive is out of the question with this human. I have only asked him one time to bring my rebound over while he was at work because his place was out of power and it was freezing out. We were out before he came home. 

Today, I had to go home to grab lunch I forgot and he had her over. We have very limited parking and she was in my spot, and when I came in I never saw her but he came in asking why I was home. I explained why shortly and left quickly, trying to hide bawling my eyes out. 

So, after this incident, WIBTBF if I asked him not to bring people over anymore? I move out in 3 weeks. I had a sudden realization that I have a lot of things I wouldn't want people to be stealing (I'm a budtender and have a closer full of product) and I'm moving and putting all my things up in boxes, a lot of things are exposed or packed away solidly. But also I really don't want this to happen again, and I want him to stop texting me about it.

"I live with my girlfriend and in a few weeks she's going away with work for the weekend. I had already mentioned to my best friend about meeting up next month for a catch up and he messaged saying a few of his friends are going out on the same night my girlfriend is away so I thought it was ideal. 

My friend lives in the town over from me so I stay on his sofa whenever I meet him for drinks in his town and he does the same when he comes to my town. The friends were a mixed gender group so including me and my friend, there will be 3 guys and 2 girls. 

The plan was just to meet in town for drinks and go on a bar crawl since there are a few good bars in the town my friend lives. I mentioned my plans to my girlfriend and she asked who was going. I told her and she got annoyed. She said she finds it weird that I'm going drinking with other women when she's away for the weekend. 

I mentioned that they were mutual friends and I've known them for years and that it's not like I planned it for that weekend, it was just a coincidence. She said it's still weird and I should have declined the invitation. I just asked what she thinks I should be doing when she's away and she just said not drinking with other women. 

I just repeated that they were friends and I'm going because it'll be nice to catch up and better than sitting in the apartment on my own. She just said I was disrespecting her but I said it's not disrespectful to go out for drinks with friends and she just repeated that I should be cancelling.

"I'm a 14 y/o girl from Germany turning 15 next month. This is specifically about my grandfather.
My grandfather used to take me onto his lap. He'd have this gross look on his face, as if he was about to drool. I only started noticing when I was five. Whenever the rest of the family left the room he'd take me on his lap and ask if I wanted to play a  game. Me being a little child, I'd say yes. He'd start playing with my hair, telling me how much I had grown and how pretty I was. Usually nothing more would happen since my family was never gone for long but one day when I was about seven years old my parents left me and my older sister at my grandparents house so they could have a couple vacation. That night my sister and grandmother where already asleep but I couldn't since my grandfather was standing in the door, watching us. I just pretend to sleep. Later that night I had to go to the bathroom. On my way back to bed my grandfather grabbed me from behind, picked me up and went to the living room. There he sat down on his chair and placed me on his lap. He said he was bored and wanted to play and that ""granny is too old to play"". I sat there quietly. He started his ""game"" again only this time he told me how much my body had developed and touched my chest. I still remember how he kissed my neck, how disgusting it felt. I wanted to run away but he was holding be down, grabbing my thigh. He told me that I was ruining the fun and that it was just a little game. I couldn't stop crying. I told him that I didn't like this game but he would just keep going. A little reminder that I was only seven years old. I don't remember the rest of the night and I'm pretty sure it's better that way. I really don't want to remember the things that old man did to me that night. Ever since then I'd avoid him but he'd keep finding ways to touch me and talk to me inappropriately. 
When I was nine years old my whole family was having dinner together. I sat next to him. He'd have his hand on my thigh the whole time. These types of incidents stopped when I turned ten. On my tenths birthday he told me that I sadly was too old to play now. Even though he didn't touch me inappropriately since then it's still making me want to throw up every time I think about it. It's almost been five years but I don't want to face him.
If anyone is gonna ask why I didn't tell my parents or anyone let me answer it. He is my mother's father and she loves him. My grandmother loves him. I love those two and I can't imagine how much this would hurt them. I want them to be happy. He is very old. He's gonna die soon anyway. I want them to believe that everything is normal so at least they can be happy. I mostly don't want them to know so they remember him as a good part of the family. I want them to keep the good memories they had with him. At least until he dies.

"So. 👏. This is just recent. And I'd like some theories and opinions. Thx. So I just finished sweeping the carpets of my workplace for roughly an hour and a half straight. I just got down to dispose the stuff I swept up into my dustpan, and my Manager, let's just call him 'Unc' and he tells me 'Wait later I talk to you.' In a tone that I personally and historically know as the 'I've done wrong' tone. And I just don't know why is he unhappy, or possibly angry. FYI. He is the Younger Brother to another manager of another workplace I worked at, whom has a personal history I will not be sharing for privacy sake. But the long and short of it, they both have the common disliking towards 'my kind', to which in most cases is those born with Asperger Syndrome and People that are considered 'Young' not like children, but more rather, young adults. Back to topic. I'm both confused but also annoyed as I'm being scoleded for something that I have done wrong, despite I was somewhere else, doing my work, AITBF.

Edit &amp; Update: This has been belated by since yesterday. (I am tired. Not big surprise.) But TL;DR. He went off at me because I lock the toilet door. Despite most toilets, even in our own houses have locks, and when it's locked, it means it's in use, and yet he sees it as a reason to scold me for this minor reason when all toilets have locks to signify other people that it is in use. And he says it in a way to blame me as if I own it. I'm well aware it is a public toilet. And yet he wants to just drill back in the warnings when I have heard it once, and only on some occassions I am unwilling to listen again. I get the message Unc. May you leave me be.

"Every time we get pizza my close friend always goes out of her way to snark on how I like to order cheese pizza. She will say how boring cheese pizza is, make fun of the fact I don’t like any toppings, she always has to say *something*. She has been doing this for years.

"I have mostly gotten over the situation, but it has been a weight on my mind for a while. I joined an organization on campus, and became friends with a person in my same major who we are gonna call Sara. Sara and I became really close friends, and we ended up being lab partners for a class we had together. The organization we were a part of held executive board elections, and Sara and I ran together for a chair position to be co-chairs. We ended up getting the position, and we had began to plan events for the next semester.

Sara ended up meeting another guy named Max that she started to hang out with. He ended up getting a chair position on the board as well. During winter break, Sara slowly began to stop talking to me. I took it up to it just being break, and we would be able to see each other next semester. When classes start, I see her and Max walking everywhere together. When the first exec meeting of the semester starts, she walks in with and sits in the back next to Max, and doesn't even say a word to me until I walk over.

It was a very awkward interaction to say the least. For our chair position, we needed to have events planned throughout the semester. I show Sara some of the ideas we had the previous semester that I had worked on over break, and she just says ""mhmm"" to everything. She then asked to do plan joint events with Max, and I say yes to be a team player.

The semester ended up being a very hard one for me mentally as I was talking 16 credit hours of really difficult classes. During that time, Sara never reached out once about anything related to events that we were supposed to plan until I see in the organization group chat she has already created events without ever telling me. This on top of the multiple hard classes did a number on my mental health. I reached out to the president of the organization and told her I would be missing the next few meetings due to classes and my mental health getting worse. The president says that was ok.

Eventually I start to feel that I was ready to return to meetings, but I come to learn through another person on the exec board that Sara said I wasn't reaching out to her about events and she is gonna replace me with a general body member Devin who happened to be the best friend of Max. This really hurt me and made my depression way worse. After that point I just stopped going to meetings. I didn't say anything just because at that point my depression was so bad I just wanted to disappear from it all. The only person who reached out was that friend who told me what was going on in the first place, and we ended up becoming really good friends to this day.

Looking back on this whole situation, I think I should have tried to reach out to others in the organization instead of just not going or explaining my situation, but at the time I just didn't know what to do. AITB?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-25T22:24:31.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have mostly gotten over the situation, but it has been a weight on my mind for a while. I joined an organization on campus, and became friends with a person in my same major who we are gonna call Sara. Sara and I became really close friends, and we ended up being lab partners for a class we had together. The organization we were a part of held executive board elections, and Sara and I ran together for a chair position to be co-chairs. We ended up getting the position, and we had began to plan events for the next semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara ended up meeting another guy named Max that she started to hang out with. He ended up getting a chair position on the board as well. During winter break, Sara slowly began to stop talking to me. I took it up to it just being break, and we would be able to see each other next semester. When classes start, I see her and Max walking everywhere together. When the first exec meeting of the semester starts, she walks in with and sits in the back next to Max, and doesn&amp;#39;t even say a word to me until I walk over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very awkward interaction to say the least. For our chair position, we needed to have events planned throughout the semester. I show Sara some of the ideas we had the previous semester that I had worked on over break, and she just says &amp;quot;mhmm&amp;quot; to everything. She then asked to do plan joint events with Max, and I say yes to be a team player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semester ended up being a very hard one for me mentally as I was talking 16 credit hours of really difficult classes. During that time, Sara never reached out once about anything related to events that we were supposed to plan until I see in the organization group chat she has already created events without ever telling me. This on top of the multiple hard classes did a number on my mental health. I reached out to the president of the organization and told her I would be missing the next few meetings due to classes and my mental health getting worse. The president says that was ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I start to feel that I was ready to return to meetings, but I come to learn through another person on the exec board that Sara said I wasn&amp;#39;t reaching out to her about events and she is gonna replace me with a general body member Devin who happened to be the best friend of Max. This really hurt me and made my depression way worse. After that point I just stopped going to meetings. I didn&amp;#39;t say anything just because at that point my depression was so bad I just wanted to disappear from it all. The only person who reached out was that friend who told me what was going on in the first place, and we ended up becoming really good friends to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

"I have been with my girlfriend for just under 3 years. She has had 2 previous relationships that both ended when they cheated on her. Her first boyfriend she has not spoken to in 6 years and the other one she hasn't spoken to in 4 years.

Her first boyfriend recently messaged asking how she has bene and just wanting to catch up. She told me about it and told me she was planning on replying. I told her I didn't see why she'd want to bother talking to him when he's not in her life anymore but just said I can't stop her talking to him.

She told me a couple more times when he messaged but I believe they have been messaging slightly more than that. She mentioned today that he suggested them going for a drink with a few other friends and catching up. I told her I wasn't comfortable with her going and she asked why. I just told her it's disrespectful to be out drinking with your ex. She said she just wants to catch up with him and the other friends but I just repeated that I wasn't comfortable with her going.

I said if she chooses to go then that will be it with us since I'm no going to just sit back while she's out drinking with her ex boyfriend. She said I was being controlling but I just pointed out I was only tell her what I am comfortable with and what I'm not comfortable with.

She said I shouldn't be telling her not to go and should be fine with her going.

"I (36NB) have been with my wife Amy (35F) for 12 years. I never wanted to get married but it's very important to Amy so a few years into our relationship I proposed and we got married.

I have always said I wanted children and she felt the same. After a couple years married, I thought it was time to start trying and Amy started throwing all of these problems in the way as reasons why we can't/won't be able to. Some valid but some we had already agreed on and now she was changing her mind:

1. We didn't own our house
2. She didn't want to carry the child (I have massive gender dysphoria about the idea of carrying a child due to being AFAB NB and am male presenting)
3. She didn't want to be a SAHM
4. She doesn't want to raise children in the city and wants to move home

I agreed to get pregnant and be the SAHP. There are so many reasons why these were very difficult things for me to agree to. I have really struggled to come to terms with these decisions but having a child means that much to me.

We've kept going back and forth on this subject for years and everytime, she throws something new at me. I agreed to all of the above. (I even set out a plan of how we could do move home but then she decided she wants to stay in the city). After she said she wasn't sure if she wanted children, then she does but doesn't know how (I gave her with all the information she could need on adoption, IVF, sperm donors etc. Now she said she thinks she's too selfish to have children. 

I am completely devastated. I love her, I don't want to leave but I also want children. I've always been clear about this and I thought it's what she wanted too. Now I can't help but feel like she never wanted children, she just wanted me. Like she has led me on and lied to me through our entire relationship. Like what I want doesn't matter, I have done my best to be understanding and supportive but I think she's taking advantage and is just waiting until it's too late for us to even try.

I don't know what to do, I've tried to accept never having children but I'm miserable, I have to at least try. I've also thought about going to marriage counselling but i don't see Amy ever agreeing to this. (Amy is 100% against it. Even a suggestion will start her on a rant, that's how strongly she feels about it).

I don't like ultimatums but I'm at my wits end. I'm heart-broken and I'm thinking all i can do is ask her to 'decide between me+children or nothing'.

"Throw away account, as I don't use reddit often.

About 6 months ago, I (27 M), made the decision to ghost a close friend (24 FM) because of the state of our friendship.

My friend (lets call her Lucy) and I originally met at my former job about 3 or 4 years ago.  At the time, I was a Team Lead, and was tasked with showing Lucy the workings of the store.  I was the sole employee responsible for training her.  Needless to say, because of this, we ended up spending a lot of time together, and quickly became friends.

After being friends for about 6 months or so, Lucy decided to tell me that she had a crush on me from basically the moment that we first met, and had decided to keep those feelings down and hidden because I had ""been one of the only people in her life to treat her like an actual person"", but she quickly realized that she couldn't keep those feelings inside.

I told her that I appreciated her confession, but we can only be friends, as I was in a very committed relationship with my girlfriend.  She said she understood, and replied with ""I just needed to tell you and get these feelings out so I could move on"".  At that point, I thought that everything was resolved, and for the time, that seemed to be the case.

Over the next 6 months, I noticed that the friendship began to feel one-sided.  Conversations were always about her, and not about anything I was dealing with in my life.

After another 2 months, I got the opportunity to quit the job we shared, and pursue my dream job. I jumped at this chance. When I told Lucy the news, she was angry that I was ""abandoning her"".  We eventually got past that, and still made time to hangout.

Soon after, my partner and I got the opportunity to move into a house with our mutual friend.  When I told Lucy, she was pissed.  Again, she accused me of abandoning her, even though I was only moving 15 minutes further away (we both have cars and drive).

It was here that we cut ties for a while.  8 months without any contact, before we reconnected and decided to give our friendship another try.

It was good for a while, but eventually, more of the same.  She confessed she never lost feelings for me, we argued whenever I couldn't hang out, and that she never made the effort to drive down to see me instead. Whenever I tried to share my feelings, I was met with silence.

Eventually, we both came to the conclusion that neither of us were ""giving the other what we wanted from this friendship"".  To me, that was a very clear sign that this was over. For good this time.

2 weeks later, she texted me asking to go see a movie with her, acting like we hadn't just ended our friendship.

I decided not to respond, because nothing I seemed to say would ever get through to her.  2 more days passed before I got another text basically saying ""I'm moving back home soon, and I hope to see you before I leave"".  I still didn't respond, and I haven't heard from her since.

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, my partner and I got the opportunity to move into a house with our mutual friend.  When I told Lucy, she was pissed.  Again, she accused me of abandoning her, even though I was only moving 15 minutes further away (we both have cars and drive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was here that we cut ties for a while.  8 months without any contact, before we reconnected and decided to give our friendship another try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good for a while, but eventually, more of the same.  She confessed she never lost feelings for me, we argued whenever I couldn&amp;#39;t hang out, and that she never made the effort to drive down to see me instead. Whenever I tried to share my feelings, I was met with silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we both came to the conclusion that neither of us were &amp;quot;giving the other what we wanted from this friendship&amp;quot;.  To me, that was a very clear sign that this was over. For good this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 weeks later, she texted me asking to go see a movie with her, acting like we hadn&amp;#39;t just ended our friendship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided not to respond, because nothing I seemed to say would ever get through to her.  2 more days passed before I got another text basically saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m moving back home soon, and I hope to see you before I leave&amp;quot;.  I still didn&amp;#39;t respond, and I haven&amp;#39;t heard from her since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AITB for ghosting Lucy because of how things ended?&lt;/p&gt;

"Hi I'm only sixteen so my perception on this may be skewed but here goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had a really bad fight with my mum (42 F) after I got mad she wouldn't let me wear the clothing I want in my room (see my last post for more info on that) after i went to my room i called my best friend we'll call her Ari for the sake of privacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called Ari and started venting about the whole situation during this i brought up one of my traumatic experiences with my mum and started re-telliing it to her because i felt it was relevant to see my p.o.v more, as I was talking about it my mum burst into my room and yelled at me to give her my phone. When I eventually handed it to her she screamed that I ""need to let it go and she's a changed woman"" because it was an event where she laid her hands on me that I've been to therapy for, and i've been clinically told was truamatic to me, I feel like that's not fair. She said I need to ""Let it go"" and, ""Stop using it as an excuse to make her look bad"" because me telling it to people paints her as a ""bad mum"" and that I can't talk about it because she ""Isn't like that anymore""

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know why, but I cant just, let go of it you know? Its always there and it haunts me a lot. She says im just ""unwilling the see the good in her"" and shes ""tried to show me she's a better mum"" and I know she's essentailly better now, but this little part in me keep's resurfacing that memory. I can't just ""get rid of it/forget it"".

"I (18F), recently delved into a relationship with someone I'll call Tom(23M) for privacy reasons. Tom and I met at an event and hit it off right away. We share the same interests, have similar music tastes, and our view of the world and everything in it is not far off.

We started dating for a while, but recent events, a story for another time, pushed us to our limit and we broke up, but still kept a casual relationship with each other.
While we were dating, he was super open about his past, specifically his past relationships including his relationship with his ex, whom I'll call Maggie(22F). Tom and Maggie have been in a relationship longer than he and I had, and during the time we were dating, he still kept in contact with her and even goes out with her sometimes, which is fine for me, as he reassured me that they were just friends. 

When Tom and I broke up, I found out that when he and Maggie broke up, he also kept a casual relationship with her, but he swore that nothing happened between them when we were together and that he kept his distance in respect for me.

Well, recently, I came over Tom's house a couple of times because staying at a house with my family is not a good option for my mental state rn. He and his family was very accommodating, and I tried my best to keep my distance with Tom as we were already broken up, but every time we were in the same room along together it seems as though we peak in our weakened state. That's how the casual relationship happened.

I came over a few days ago, and he asked me out of the blue if it would be okay if I won't come over for the next few weeks because Maggie will be at their house and would be working for them for the time being (renovations are underway, Maggie is an designer). I didn't respond but inside I was feeling a bit jealous because I am still in love with this dude and knowing that something other than work would be happening to them when we recently just broke up hurts me tbh.

"This happened a year and a half ago

I (25f) was with my ex Sam (24m) for 8 months, everything genuinely felt perfect. We loved and cared about each other so much, I didn't expect him to change slowly, or maybe he didn't change and I just started noticing what he'd say/do that were red flags. But honestly, my past relationship I had done similar and it ended worse (him being very physically/verbally abusive, but that's another story)

&amp;#x200B;

Things were great with Sam and I, we both suffer from depression and anxiety thought his was a bit worse. He said he'd tried therapy for him, but the therapist was bad and never went back. For a while I could see myself having a real future with him, we made each other really happy. I tried really hard to help comfort him with his issues and be as supportive as I could, even if it caused my own mental health to diminish. One of my biggest deal breakers is lying, and I had already told him this when we started dating. 

Over time, I noticed he'd start lying to me, or changing certain details to make himself look better. At his job, people said snarky comments to him to get a rise out of him, and he'd get aggressive. When I heard from him about his aggression, it really worried me and I tried asking him if he'd be more open to therapy, as I have a history of parental abuse and I refuse to be with someone who's so quick to anger. He refused and apologized profusely, claiming when he'd move he would seek therapy. Of course this bothered me. Him having such rage without seeking therapy and expecting me to be fine with that was a huge red flag. I'd found through a photo \*HE sent me of himself\* later, he'd been cheating with me online with another woman. He claimed his ""friend"" wanted him to see her OF page for ""support"". I told him it was absolute BS and not to bother me. 

A week or so later, he had gone through a mental breakdown and started telling me if I ever left him, he'd u-n- ali-ve himself. I'd never had someone threaten this against me and something clicked in my head that I needed out of this. I didn't want to push him over the edge or make things worse, so I waited a couple days for him to calm down. 

I went over to one of my friends to ask for advice and she told me what he's said is not healthy for me to be around. Her talking to me gave me the courage I needed to end it. 

I called him to talk to him and let him know I can't continue the relationship and that I hope he finds the help he needs. I didn't let him know the reasons why I left and he cried saying how he thought we had a good future together and that things were going well. I refused to say anything more and left it at that. I blocked him and went back to my friends to calm down. 

Recently he followed one of my socials through another account and I had to block him.

It's made me feel maybe I was too harsh with how I left and didn't tell him, but I was worried if I did it would've ""push ed"" him to harm himself. AITAH?

I tried really hard to help comfort him with his issues and be as supportive as I could, even if it caused my own mental health to diminish. One of my biggest deal breakers is lying, and I had already told him this when we started dating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, I noticed he&amp;#39;d start lying to me, or changing certain details to make himself look better. At his job, people said snarky comments to him to get a rise out of him, and he&amp;#39;d get aggressive. When I heard from him about his aggression, it really worried me and I tried asking him if he&amp;#39;d be more open to therapy, as I have a history of parental abuse and I refuse to be with someone who&amp;#39;s so quick to anger. He refused and apologized profusely, claiming when he&amp;#39;d move he would seek therapy. Of course this bothered me. Him having such rage without seeking therapy and expecting me to be fine with that was a huge red flag. I&amp;#39;d found through a photo *HE sent me of himself* later, he&amp;#39;d been cheating with me online with another woman. He claimed his &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; wanted him to see her OF page for &amp;quot;support&amp;quot;. I told him it was absolute BS and not to bother me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week or so later, he had gone through a mental breakdown and started telling me if I ever left him, he&amp;#39;d u-n- ali-ve himself. I&amp;#39;d never had someone threaten this against me and something clicked in my head that I needed out of this. I didn&amp;#39;t want to push him over the edge or make things worse, so I waited a couple days for him to calm down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went over to one of my friends to ask for advice and she told me what he&amp;#39;s said is not healthy for me to be around. Her talking to me gave me the courage I needed to end it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called him to talk to him and let him know I can&amp;#39;t continue the relationship and that I hope he finds the help he needs. I didn&amp;#39;t let him know the reasons why I left and he cried saying how he thought we had a good future together and that things were going well. I refused to say anything more and left it at that. I blocked him and went back to my friends to calm down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently he followed one of my socials through another account and I had to block him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s made me feel maybe I was too harsh with how I left and didn&amp;#39;t tell him, but I was worried if I did it would&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;push ed&amp;quot; him to harm himself. AITAH?&lt;/p&gt;

"I don't want to share what exactly we were talking about, so I'll use 'shopping'. It's work related.

He asked me if I've done my shopping yet, and that it's probably time. I said I was thinking about shopping at the mall. He said that he thinks ordering online is better. I asked why he thought that and he explained. I counter argued and said I still want to do it my way. He said 'okay then, but I've been online shopping before and everyone i know who needed to shop, does it online and they have no problems.' It went back and forth like this, until I got pissed and said sth like: 'just let me go shopping the way I want to!'
He said: 'why do you have to make a discussion about a small thing again?' I said: 'Are you f kidding me?' He said: 'Why are you getting so emotional?' I was getting super angry and frustrated, trying to explain that I felt like he was pushing me to this point and I didn't ask for his opinion. He said sth like: 'Let's just not talk anymore, you're too emotional...' 'sorry for trying to help you with my experience.' 'Why are we still talking about this? For me this discussion was over long ago. Don't talk to me, I don't want to deal with this rn.'

Even after we talked later, we both still thought the other one was wrong. 
This type of fight happened before, where he criticized sth I wanted to do regarding my work. I ask him why he thinks so, I listen, I still want to do it my way, but he can't accept that. I lash out because I feel like I keep repeating myself and he says I'm too emotional in discussions. That makes me even angrier. Every time I just need him to go: 'ok, do it your way.' Instead of 'ok, but...' I keep telling him. I get so angry that I start to angry cry and say things like 'You're manipulative' 'This is fd up, the way you turn it around like I started it' 'I can't do this. If it's going to be like this every time I want to break up.' I am ashamed of that and I don't want our relationship to be like this.

Some background. I'm in therapy for social anxiety, specifically people pleasing and I have a hard time receiving criticism, even advice without feeling invalidated / dismissed. I've gotten a lot better, but I worry that this is the cause of this reoccurring fight. He on the other hand always wants to be right and he said today, that even if we disagree, he wants to have the last word just to make sure. That makes me feel like he doesn't accept my opinion and wants to keep arguing to persuade me. But he feels, he's just giving his opinion and I don't have to react.

All of this sounds so horrible... We love each other, this is the only thing we seriously fight about and I fear that I'm the problem.
I don't know what to do now, I feel guilty that we fought on this special day, but I still feel justified in my reaction.

"Whenever I sleep in the same bed as my bf he tosses and turns so much that I rarely get any more than 3 hours of sleep. I am exhausted when this happens, but power through so it doesn't show as much. He has a basement where we sleep when I go over, and his bedroom.

He wants to be in the same bed cause he feels it builds intimacy and promotes bonding. But even if it is only 33% of the time, that is still a lot of lost sleep.

"This whole thing essentially started when I went to my dad’s girlfriend's family Christmas.  ( my parents are divorced). There I met her nieces and we all seemed to get along pretty well.
 One of the girls ended up giving me her phone number and I thought nothing of it at the time.
    After two days I finally texted B and we began talking.  A couple days later B was flat out flirting with me.  At first I didn’t really know what to do so I ended up asking friends for advice on whether I should return the flirting.  Most didn’t see the problem as long as I didn’t date her if my dad and her aunt got married so I went for it.  We talked and everything was fine until we got onto the topic of potentially being related.  I asked B a question I should have asked her WAYYY earlier: if she would be upset if I broke up with her if my dad married my aunt.  I knew things were definitely going down hill because of the “I don’t know” response (which was valid but still) and I got the “I really like you a lot and we wouldn’t TECHNICALLY be related” around 4 times even after I explained I didn’t want to mess up my dads relationship with his girlfriend.  The conversation continued and B’s solution was to just never tell anyone, even if we ended up getting serious and my dad married her aunt.  I ended up breaking things off the nicest way I could but telling her I was still open to being friends so she could feel free to call or text me.  


    Two weeks later and B’s stepsister
(Well call her E) calls me out of NOWHERE using B’s phone.  I picked up and  E had taken B’s phone and called me while she was in the shower, without her consent or knowledge and decided to tell someone she had never even spoken to to get back together with B.  
     I know she was probably thinking she was helping B . But I honestly was not happy with the situation at all, though I surprisingly was able to keep my sarcastic mouth closed and remain polite Throughout the conversation.  She essentially gave me the same argument B did and brushed aside my concerns about AHEM somewhat incest and the fact that I didn’t want to mess with my dads relationship.  She again told me what B said, which was just to not tell anyone.  Not telling someone, especially my dad’s girlfriend who’s been like a 2nd mother to me since me and my mom don’t particularly get along would have been impossible. if her and my dad got married then that would feel like a huge betrayal of her love and trust.  I would have been fine continuing seeing B, as I liked her alot, if my dad and his girlfriend hadn’t worked out (though I would be upset as I would rather no other woman be my stepmom). But the chance was small as this was their third Christmas as a couple and their relationship is to the point that me and my brother are on the family Christmas ornament.

"A few nights ago my (25m) boyfriend (25m) met this homeless man who was about our age while he was out with a friend (i stayed hoke because i had a tummy ache). My boyfriend bemng an extremely empathetic dude immediately offers him our couch, THEN asks me about it. to which I respond “ABSOLUTELY NOT” because I do not know this person and this made my boyfriend sad. He said “but i already offered him a place to stay…” and i basically responded with “too bad I don’t feel comfortable letting a stranger in my home over night.”

Our friend he was out with ended up letting him stay with her and her husband for the night and i went over to hang out because by that time I was feeling better.

The guy ended up being super chill and understood why I was acting so cagey, but then he started making all these claims about how he’s got a warrant in a neighboring state for a hit and run felony. It felt like he was bragging about it, and told us he was on the run but nobody got hurt so its okay.

After we got home my boyfriend told me he was disappointed I wouldn’t let him stay the night, and that i should try and be more empathetic to those in need.  I brought up how he was bragging about being a felon but he said “theres no way you could’ve known that when you said no.”

The next day I get a call from my friends saying that he not only stole their xbox and PlayStation and dipped but he also ate all of the food in the fridge leaving wrappers and crumbs everywhere and was gone before morning. My boyfriend admitted it was good that I said no but he was still disappointed in my lack of empathy for a stranger.

Am I the buttface here?

Update: we talked about it and he apologized for being “pigheaded” about it.  And despite what people are saying, I am not breaking up with him because he is very good to me and he did listen when I said no. He admitted that he felt stupid and the reason he got upset is because he doesn’t like feeling stupid because he’s been made to feel that way his entire life.

"Would I be the buttface if I asked my room-mate to start taking shorter showers.

I 28 f share an apartment with 20 f. We share one bathroom between us.

My room-mate takes a long time in the bathroom, frequently she'll be in there 20 minutes or so just for brushing her teeth, getting ready etc.

at least 2x a week she will have the bathroom for 40-45 minutes at a time, these seem to be hair wash days. I know this because upon exiting the shower will be coated in her coconut conditioner...which leaves a slimy residue everywhere---I think she must be wet-combing because it's flicked all over the walls. I have very different hair to her, so my shower routine, even on my hair wash days is generally 10-15 mins max. 

WIBTB if I asked her to consider having shorter showers, or being more conscious of water consumption; running a hot shower for 20 minutes + every other day is in my opinion actually wasteful, I pee a lot, and its agitating having to worry about planning my time to pee in case she goes in there for 40-45 minutes when I need to go... is she actually taking a long time, or does it just take that long to wash thicker hair?

I have very different hair to her, so my shower routine, even on my hair wash days is generally 10-15 mins max. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WIBTB if I asked her to consider having shorter showers, or being more conscious of water consumption; running a hot shower for 20 minutes + every other day is in my opinion actually wasteful, I pee a lot, and its agitating having to worry about planning my time to pee in case she goes in there for 40-45 minutes when I need to go... is she actually taking a long time, or does it just take that long to wash thicker hair? &lt;/p&gt;

Hi, I know how the title sounds but please hear me out!

I (NB18) had dated my ex (M19) for three years. I already know our relationship wasn't the best but we were just kids and so i *did* not have any negative feelings towards him and we remained best friends.

When he and I started dating he introduced me to his friend (now F17) and her and I hit it off. She became my best friend quickly and she was constantly reassuring me that she would ""never date my (at the time) bf because he was like a brother to her AND she ONLY LIKES WOMEN"".

I never worried about her because she claimed to be a lesbian the three years my bf and i were together. This summer my ex and I were really close to getting back together until she came to me and said that she thinks she isn't a lesbian but bi (which is cool bc i am too) and she likes my ex.

Here's where I begin to believe I was the buttface, I told her that I would not be okay with them dating and that would ruin our friendship but I wouldn't stop her if that's what she really wanted. She ended up calling me an buttface and claiming that I had apparently ""told her that it was okay if she dated him"" which I hadn't.

She also told me that I was trying to make myself a victim because she started talking to him.

They have now been dating officially for a month so I cut them both off, I didn't block them because if they really need me I'll be there, but am I the buttface for letting this ruin two friendships?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-20T22:27:48.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I know how the title sounds but please hear me out!&lt;/p&gt;

"My BF(28M) and I(27F) have been dating since high-school. when I was 18 my parents kicked me out of school because they believed turning 18 means I should be independent now, with no where to go my bf dropped out of university after 1 year and took me in, he worked full time to put me through university and feed me. I graduated and started being a housewife.

When my Bf turned 28 last week he had a mental breakdown it was the first time I have seen him emotional about anything, he was worried about turning 30 and not finishing university, making him believe he was an idiot, i don't see how this can be an issue to anyone but whatever. 

Last night my bf came up with a plan he suggested I start working using my masters degree so he can go back to university suggesting we switch roles for the time being so we can both build a happy wealth family. I gave his plan some thought but I needed an outside view my friends all told me that my Bf is just using, manipulating and forcing me to return a favor. I do believe I should not be working to support someone who ""Choose"" to help me out 

I am grateful for my boyfriends help after all this time but I am not going to waste 4 years of my life supporting him to get an engineering degree. WIBTA if I dump him?

I have two daughters, a 16 yo and a 13yo. The subject of this is the 16yo. She was diagnosed autistic when she was 5, but I haven't told her about it. I don't want her to label herself as she can be really capable.

When she was little I tried therapy for her motor skills but unfortunately these help hadn't improved her much.

Seeing another girl in her grade who everyone knew was autistic get excluded and treated differently by everyone else, I believe I have made the right decision for my daughter not telling the school. My daughter is not popular but she has a few friends and is not systematically excluded.

Her younger sister has been saying that my 16yo is autistic quite a lot lately. I do not know where she got that from and I have put a stop to her saying it.

"For background context, I am neurodivergent and don’t understand certain social norms. So that’s why I’m here asking people who might (cue sarcastic comments about redditors). 

My husband and I are part of a friend group that regularly plays RPGs. In fact, we were planning to start a new RPG campaign tomorrow. We had our session zero last Saturday. My husband did not attend this because he was tired and grouchy. Apparently he has not been getting enough sleep for the past several weeks. 

Our GM has been trying to get together with him for character creation and so he can plan the first session beats (the game is roleplay-heavy and relies on character arcs over combat). My husband told me today that he is planning to skip the first session because he just doesn’t feel up to the task of session zero. This is understandable. He has not yet conveyed this to our GM. He told me he was going to text him tonight explaining the situation. 

I asked my husband around 6 pm if he had texted the GM yet. He told me no. 3-4 hours later, I asked him again. He snapped at me. This is not the first time I have been snapped at for asking a question twice, even hours apart. 

Specifically I want to know if I am being a nag/annoying by asking the same question twice even spaced out over time. Multiple people have treated me with annoyance for this behavior. Is it really such asshole behavior to ask a simple question?

Also, for those who would tell me my husband is a jerk, he did apologize later for snapping at me.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-20T04:59:35.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For background context, I am neurodivergent and don’t understand certain social norms.

Ladies and gentlemen, significant progress has been made.

Again, I want to thank everyone for their help and input, but specifically I’d like to thank u/CaptColten for some of his comments he made that helped verbalize how I was feeling. 

A few days after our last talk she asked me to talk again after work so that’s just what we did. We discussed the cycle that we were in, I was able to I think pretty clearly illustrate how we are in a cycle of spending less time together-&gt;having less sex/unfulfilling sex-&gt;spending less time together etc. 

After this talk it felt like we were understanding each other better. I felt like I had a better grasp on her feeling and she had a better grasp on mine.

A day or 2 later she ASKED ME how I was feeling about sex later that evening. I was stunned, as this is not something I’d expect from her. I told her maybe, we will see how I feel later. 

Later that evening, for the first time in years if not ever, she legitimately initiated. I don’t want to go into detail as this isn’t the place for it, but I’ll just say it made me feel wanted, it made me feel so desired, validated, LOVED! It lead to the absolute, without a doubt, best sex we’ve ever had.

The next day we talked about it again. I’ll tell you the same analogy I told her. I told her love is like a cup. When you do something that makes your partner feel loved, it’s like pouring a little water in their glass. The less water in your glass the harder it is to give water to your partner. Before when we had sex once a month it felt like an ounce of water in my cup. My cup feels like it’s overflowing right now. 

I don’t know if that makes sense to everyone, but it makes sense to me, and seems to make sense to her. 

We had sex again 2 days later. 

It’s been 4 days I think since we last had sex. A month ago it’d be all I could think about. Now it seems like the least important thing in the world. A month ago going on a date or hanging out with my wife felt like a chore. Now, all I want to do is spoil her and spend as much time as possible with her. 

We still have some stuff to figure out regarding our relationship with sex, but it feels like we are finally on solid ground. Like we finally have an understanding of each other that we can use to solve these problems in the future. That feels so good.

For a little background, I am the oldest child &amp; have a brother(21).Since childhood mistakes were rewarded with beatings which is a common thing in our family and friend circle but not in every household, I learned later.I remember that I had sworn to protect my brother from the beatings which never happened.Since I was kid I had noticed favourtism towards my brother.I was close to my mom initially but all changed once I went to college &amp; started favouring my brother.We both faced the controlling aspects of our parents especially with regards to privacy. As kids our mom would tell us about maritial problems and bitch about my paternal family(they didn't treat my mom well) which made me resent them and my father.As we both grew we understood that our mom is emotional &amp; manipulative &amp; our father is practical.My mom never got the opportunity to study &amp; work so takes out the jealousy in form of anger and taunts towards me imo. I love you or sorry is not used in the house.My brother is privy to everything going on in family &amp; my life but not me.Anything that goes wrong in my brother life is somehow my fault &amp; get  berated for it.Theres a lot of hurt but it will never change. 

Now today's situation, we moved to a new house &amp; in process of getting unpacked &amp; organised.I have a cat for past 2 years, my parents hate cats (lost their 1st child during childbirth due to infection from cat saliva).They asked me to leave my toxic job it was severely affecting my mental &amp; physical health &amp; they asked for 5 months to do so and move in with them they knew it would be with my cat.I was not aware of the reason of the hatred of cats until a year back but manage it well and try to keep both my parents and cat happy.At night Mom and I were moving heavy comforter from my room to another in the process my cat again got scared &amp; hissed &amp; tried to nip at my dad's leg.Cat doesn't bite hard to puncture skin she does toshow she is scared.He thought my cat is attacking him, he shouted &amp; then threw a shoe to hit her.Seeing this I immediately tried to run towards my cat my mom was in front &amp; in that frantic situation I tried move her to the side but she fell &amp; I tried to catch her &amp; I am sorry she got hurt.she said I pushed her.she has the tendency of dramatising things &amp; she does have balance problems, she is overweight.I ran towards my cat to check on her.I lost my cool as she could have been seriously hurt and started shouting at my dad.I told him to say sorry.He said to not ask stupid things &amp; just gave angry looks.Now I am in my room &amp; I refuse to interact with them until they apologise to me and my cat.

"Me and my friend are college students who share a class together. Yesterday, when we got out of class, he told me that he had his eyes on a girl sitting in the same row as us, and that he thought she was cute and wanted to ask her out.

I told him that wasn't a good idea, because she could already be taken. I also said that even if they started dating, breaking up would make things extremely awkward since we're all in the same class - and the professor uses attendance sheets. The class we share isn't one of those big lecture halls with hundreds of students, it's a small one with about 25-30 students.

My friend said why I couldn't be more supportive, and I told him that I was just being pragmatic and that she isn't worth it for the reasons I mentioned above.   


He was still upset and said that he just wants to find someone to be happy with, and that I shouldn't ruin that for him. I told him that there's better places to look for people to be in a relationship with, like a club or a public event, and if things don't work out he will never see them again, making it easier to move on. He wouldn't be able to do that with someone that he shares a class with, which would make it hurt more if she either turned him down or if they broke up.

I told him again that I was only being pragmatic and that he should focus on doing well in the class.

The class we share isn&amp;#39;t one of those big lecture halls with hundreds of students, it&amp;#39;s a small one with about 25-30 students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend said why I couldn&amp;#39;t be more supportive, and I told him that I was just being pragmatic and that she isn&amp;#39;t worth it for the reasons I mentioned above.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was still upset and said that he just wants to find someone to be happy with, and that I shouldn&amp;#39;t ruin that for him. I told him that there&amp;#39;s better places to look for people to be in a relationship with, like a club or a public event, and if things don&amp;#39;t work out he will never see them again, making it easier to move on. He wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to do that with someone that he shares a class with, which would make it hurt more if she either turned him down or if they broke up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him again that I was only being pragmatic and that he should focus on doing well in the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I the buttface in this scenario for just being pragmatic with my friend?&lt;/p&gt;

"My best friend of 10 years and I are both 21, we moved in together at 18. She has been too dependent on me which may be because she has autism. However, we are both the same age and planned on finishing college together. One year into college she failed out because she refused to go to class or do any homework, and we stayed living together while she got a full time job at walmart. 

However, I have to beg her to do anything at all in the home. Washing dishes, sweeping, and cleaning the litter boxes for our shared cats is all she has to do daily for the home but half the time I have to remind her multiple times and it causes arguments. I have to drive her to and from work and budget her money for her because otherwise she will spend it all and we wont have enough for house supplies and food and gas, which has happened multiple times. 

She yelled at me and would not allow me to help her with choosing her health insurance, and when she obviously messed it up, she came into my room and stole my medication for herself while I was away. Its to the point where I hold her bank card so she wont use it all the time. I ended up getting facial paralysis due to stress because I am still a full time student and my partner has cancer, in addition to me needing to plan and execute all things related to the cats and the apartment. 

When I was in the hospital for a week due to paralysis, I came home to the house smelling like cat piss and the cats has used the bathroom in the kitchen because she refused to clean the litter boxes while I was in the hospital but lied and told me she was taking care of them. I spent my first night home from the hospital cleaning the entire house because I am a clean freak and was disgusted at the neglect of the household chores and the cats.

 Now, I am physically unable to do everything I used to do for her such as driving, and I get dizzy doing the home chores, and I am starting to want to leave the friendship all together. I am graduating college in May and I don't want this much stress in my life anymore. I told her if she continues to be so irresponsible, i.e overspending the budget and/or not doing her chores list without being asked, we will have to get rid of her cat because she has proven she is unable to care for the cat and I cannot physically do it anymore. 

After giving her cat away, if her irresponsibility continues, we will have to not live together anymore and I will have to leave her by herself. Any time I try to hold her accountable, she turns into a toddler and has a mental breakdown and blames everything on autism. However, I don't think autism makes someone incapable of doing 3 chores and only spending cash from a specific envelope of expendable income.

"TLDR: My friend was heartbroken when her bf broke up with her, I learned that her bf cheated on her years later but I didn't tell her to save her from the pain. Now they're friends again and I still didn't tell her about the cheating.

This story spans a five year period but I'll try to keep it short.

So I knew this guy ""Mike"" and his girlfriend ""Nancy"" while we were all in college around 24 yo, 4 years ago from now. 
At the time, I just recently broke up with my bf during my semester abroad and Mike was about to go abroad for 6 months for an exchange program. When we were saying goodbyes to each other, he asked me ""what it was like to break up while on an exchange program"" since it was such a cliché and I also heard him complain about Nancy prior to this question. So I had my doubts about him wanting to break up but he didn't admit to it when I asked. Part of me wanted to tell Nancy all this, but we weren't besties then and she had this argumentative side to her so I wanted to let them work it out themselves.

The following months Nancy and I actually became really close friends, spent a lot of time together and she was always talking so highly about Mike, telling how much they love each other and how much she misses him. I was trying to point out his bad qualities in hopes that she falls out of love but with no luck.
 
Then when Mike returned, he broke up with her, and it devastated her. It took 2 years before she was actually over him, even then I knew she would return to him in a blink if he wanted it. 

This was when I learned about his girlfriend back when he was abroad. He apparently was cheating on her and kept the relationship going for months. But Nancy was FINALLY ok at that point and I didn't want her to get hurt even more so I thought it was best if she didn't know this.

She moved to a different city a year after that, and we had our own share of arguments so we're not close friends anymore. But I recently saw some stories on instagram of them hanging out together, I asked her if they're dating and she said no, they're just friends now.

I still can't tell her that he's a cheater, partly because I don't want her to be sad and partly because I doubt she'll believe me. AITBF for not telling her? Should I tell her, or confront Mike about it?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-18T13:29:34.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: My friend was heartbroken when her bf broke up with her, I learned that her bf cheated on her years later but I didn&amp;#39;t tell her to save her from the pain.

"Am I the buttface? Me (Male, 14) and one of my friends (Male, 14) met in 2023 at a Halloween party. And since then, the guy, his name being Kris, as had a massive crush on me ever since. As I'm getting to know Kris, I learn that he isn't overly well liked, and he clung to me because I was kind to him. All I did was give him my jacket for a bit when he was cold on Halloween. Says a lot about how people treat him.

Here's the thing, I personally don't have feelings in a romantic way for Kris. It's not that I don't swing that way, I honestly have no clue what sexuality I am, however all I know is that I don't really want Kris as my partner. He's not my type.

I know this may sound harsh, but I want a partner who takes care of themselves. Kris does not, as he barely even eats properly, doesn't really take showers, and doesn't care about his grades a school. This is probably a result of his iffy mental state, so I know leaving him like this could be destructive.

In fact, anytime I mention leaving him, he'll tell me that he'll off himself or say 'looks like im not making it to 18.'

I had made a joke once about running away to Canada with him once I grew up, and now he's serious on it. He'll plan it out, figure out streets, etc. As I already stated that I don't want him as my boyfriend, but I also plan to go to New York when I grow up. I want to go to an art school, and I don't want to waste my life spending time with him because I want him to be happy.

I have kissed Kris before, but it was really only for his benefit. And I feel like a terrible person for treating him so nicely but none of it is actually real. I'm afraid that if I leave and tell him I don't have feelings, he would try to do something really stupid.

I could be seen as the asshole because I treated him so nicely and now I'm just dropping him. I feel like I'm manipulating his feelings, but I'm just trying to make him feel better.

So, am I the buttface?

"I’m going to try to keep this short. I (33M) am a lawyer, and a commissioned officer in the USAF Reserves. I am friends and drinking buddies with one of my former airmen (31M) who left the military back in 2019.

As a matter of fact, during one deployment over to the UK, he went out of his way to connect with the local Iranian community, and I made a lot of mental notes about him being too much of a hippy to be in the US military.

Earlier this month, I raised this point to my friend when we went out for the night. He was visibly uncomfortable, but I felt like I needed to press the issue with him because I feel strongly about this whole thing.

"I have a group of friends and we've been a group for a while but some of us have started to distance (one guy is getting engaged, another has joined his bf's friend group, etc.) so I kind of separated my friend group into sections- close friends (the ones I can feel that I can drop my guard around), close-ish friends (the ones I can tell a little bit more about what's going on) and the peripheral friends (just like chilling together and don't talk about any of the deep stuff).

The last 5 years have been an absolute disaster but three of the friends have been there. I think just how bad things gotten really showed who your true brothers in arms are and who's just a friend in name.

Our friend group (all 3 categories) usually do birthdays together but this year I'd like to have one with just my brothers in arms privately then another one with everybody else.

"I (8M) live in a small mountain town in Colorado with my stupid, immature friends. I've wanted to become a man for a while, so a teenage boy (15M) offered to sell me pubes for $10. I bought them with my hard-earned cash, only to find out from my dumbass friends that I was scammed and that you actually have to wait for pubic hair to grow on you. To make matters worse, when I tried to get this asshole to refund me, he took the rest of my money and burned it all.

Long story short, I finally managed to get back at him. I tricked him into believing that I was going to get a local pony to bite off his weiner at a chili cookoff I organized, so that he would send his parents to ""rescue"" said pony. The pony's owner is a crazy redneck, so I informed him that violent pony killers were in the area. Assuming the teen's parents were the violent pony killers I told him about, he shot and killed them when he saw them on his property.

As the redneck was giving his report, I was able to steal the bodies and use a hacksaw to make chili out of their flesh. The teenager, not realizing his parents were dead, happily ate the chili I cooked for him, only for me to reveal the truth to him afterwards. Not only did I trick him into eating his own parents and make him cry, but I even humiliated him in front of his favorite band!

"I seem to get a lot of strangers who like to make comparisons to me with celebrities. Working in retail, this happens even more than I'd be happy to admit...

But I've always felt extremely uncomfortable and funny over it. I'm sure it's just and eccentric affectation of my own... But I consider myself as me. I don't consider myself to be comparable to anyone.

They are them, and I am me. Only I can be me... And only they can be them.

So when people randomly compare me to a celebrity (I squirm a little inside). I presume people are trying to be flattering but it just does the opposite.

I get told I look like a model a lot (and that's okay) because it's kind of vague and general and leaves something to the imagination while still allowing me to retain my own sense of identity. And is more a compliment than a direct comparison to someone else. But I've also been told I look like *''that guy from Vampire Diaries''* and *''the guy from The Witcher.''*

This morning I was serving this lady, and I could feel her eyes pressed on me while I packaged her items before she finally interjected with *''Has anyone ever told you before that you look like a movie star?...''*

At first, I found it flattering as I thought she meant it in the generic sense, as in, she thought I was attractive enough to be an actor. But then she continued that I looked like some movie star (but that she couldn't remember his name).

I kind of wrote it off. But then later in the day, a co-worker of mine started his shift, and I think he was trying to be complimentary. Because we were talking about Lord of the Rings and then that segued into Ant-Man and from there onto Paul Rudd. And he goes *''Paul Rudd is so dreamy, those eyes are of his are so dreamy. Kind of like yours! You kind of look like Paul Rudd. Has anyone ever told you that?!?!''*

And I get he was being nice. But it just kind of pissed me off. I don't think I look like Paul Rudd at all. And I'm getting tired of being constantly compared to people.

Now I feel kind of depressed because my brain is like *''what if the lady from earlier in the day was thinking of Paul Rudd as well?!?''*

"I live with my identical twin brother (Matt) and his gf (Holly). I sleep on the couch and Matt and Holly have the bedroom. I was at home yesterday while the other two were both out. Matt was at work, and his schedule is always the same so I assumed Holly knew this too.

Anyway, Holly came in pretty late last night, with her friend. She was pretty drunk. The friend left after getting her in the apartment, and she sat next to me on my bed/the couch and leaned on me. We have cuddled on the couch before so I didn't think it was weird. She was really giggly but she wasn't saying anything too weird, just talking about the game I was playing. Then she kissed me on the mouth.

I'm autistic so I'm not really good at social situations and I didn't know what to do. It didn't occur to me that she maybe thought I was my brother, because she can always tell us apart. We're identical but we're pretty different personality-wise and have different hair. Our friends and family pretty much never get us mixed up. Also, because it wouldn't make since for Matt to miss work. I thought she did it intentionally and I didn't know whether she meant it in a friendly way or a romantic way so I just sat still and kind of ignored her. She kissed me two more times and kept cuddling me and giggling.

She went to bed before Matt got home. I didn't tell him about it because I still didn't know what to think and I thought I might be making a big deal about it if she meant it in a friendly way. She told him about it this morning and he woke me up, pissed off that I let that happen and didn't tell her who I was right away. He doesn't believe me that I didn't know she thought I was him, and he says that I basically coerced her by not telling her.

"I have been with my girlfriend for over 3 and a half years now. When we first started dating we discussed important things like marriage and children to make sure we were on the same page. We agreed that neither of us are too bothered about marriage but we would bother like two or three children.

A couple of months ago my girlfriend said she doesn't know if she wanted children anymore. She said she doesn't want them to hold her back form things she wants to do such as travelling and nice holidays etc. She said she wasn't sure and that she might change her mind further down the line anyway. 

I mentioned that having children was a big topic that we need to be on the same page on so maybe it's best to have some time to think about it and then have a proper discussion which she agreed and said we should talk after she's had a few months to think things through. 

After a couple of months we sat down to talk about it and she said she still felt the same. I mentioned to her that my views on children haven't changed and that I still would like to have a couple of children. She said she might change her mind at some point anyway but I mentioned that it's not really a risk I'd want to take and that we really need to be on the same page or the relationship won't work. 

I said if she doesn't want children then it just might mean that we're not compatible anymore. She accused me of pressuring her into having kids but I pointed out that's not what I was doing, I was just saying it wouldn't be fair to either of us to have to agree with the other since it would just lead to resentment. 

She just repeated again that I was wrong for pressuring her to have children but I again just pointed out that's not what I was doing. She accused me of being unreasonable for thinking about breaking up with her because she doesn't want children.

"I live in the UK and my partner and I had a holiday booked for yesterday which we were really looking forward to. Last week I had an uncomfortable feeling in my right hand side. I had a doctors appointment for something else anyway so I mentioned this and they said it is likely to be nothing and to let them know if it gets any worse.

For a day or two it was still there but not painful so I didn't think about it and then the day before our flight I was in horrible pain. I was advised to go to A&amp;E as it was possible appendicitis. I went to A&amp;E and it was a 5 hour wait which meant I was in awful pain for the full thing and also we missed our flight since it was an early flight and we were supposed to be staying over at an airport hotel .

When I saw a doctor they did an ultrasound and felt my stomach and side. They said it wasn't appendicitis but they weren't sure what it was. They prescribed me some painkillers and sent me home. One of the first comments my girlfriend made was ""well there's the holiday ruined"" and she mentioned that we'd lost our money. 

I pointed out I could hardly have just ignored the fact I was in pain and she just said I can't exactly expect her to be fine with losing money and missing out on the trip. I told her the least she could do was show some compassion and she just said that we still could have went since the doctors didn't do anything. I just repeated she could at least act like she cares and that I could hardly help being ill.

I 18m have a friend 17m. He’s Bi, we were at his house with some other friends just pre drinking in his kitchen before going out. 

We’re all talking about whether he or this girl that was there gets with the most people when we’re out (this wasn’t like a competition he was really embarrassed lol) 

While we’re having a conversation his dad walks in the kitchen to get something and I carry on the conversation as normal just jokingly saying you are kind of a slut tho like I always see you going with some boy at some point. And i talked about how it’s weird because he doesn’t seem like that type of person usually until you see it. 

His dad walks out of the room and my friend had a real go at me for embarrassing him like he was proper pissed. But his dad is so chill like he literally buys him weed, well buys for himself and let’s him take a bit but my parents would actually execute me for buying it myself. 

He even agreed his dad wasn’t going to judge him for what I said but it’s just embarrassing. And imo you can’t get too mad at a little embarrassment that’s normal.

"This happened when I was 14 or 15 years and to this day, I don't know whether it was a very bad joke or assault. I'm a female, by the way.

One time, after recess, I said goodbye to my friends and I was putting my jacket in one of the coat hangers when suddenly, out of nowhere, a boy put his hands on my hips.

Now, this boy in particular was one I didn't get along with, mainly because he used to pick on me and my friends from time to time. He was the ""class clown"" and sometimes picked up on people or made fun of them just for shit and giggles. He was never truly physical, more like verbal harassment.

Anyways, this guy out of nowhere, put his hands on my hips, rubbed his dick along my butt and acted as if we were having sex, saying ""Oh, yeah, fuck me in the bed!"" and moving as if we were fucking.

I was disgusted to say the least, and quite scared, so I inmediately pushed him away. He fell against the coat hanger and he let out a dramatic scream, making some people turn around their heads and laugh at what was happening.

One of his friends came up to me and told me ""Blue Dandellion, what are you doing? Leave him alone!"" and him and the one that grabbed my hips pushed me against the blackboard until the teacher came.

I felt so humilliated and embarrassed and inmediately left to the bathroom to have a good cry. I always thought it was a bad joke so I didn't tell anyone what happened until one year later, when I told my parents what happened to me. They were absolutely angry and told me I should've told them sooner.

Even so, those people laughed and it's not like we were naked or anything. We were fully clothed. And when they pushed me against the blackboard they kept laughing mockingly and giving me nasty glares.

I used to love when people I care about hugged me from behind but ever since then, when someone does that, I can't help but tense up a little bit.

So AITBF for pushing that boy away? Were they just joking and this was a joke of a very bad taste? Was I being dramatic? Or was this some type of assault?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-17T11:01:48.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened when I was 14 or 15 years and to this day, I don&amp;#39;t know whether it was a very bad joke or assault.

Edit 2- she is gone! I took her to the shelter she chose around 130pm(its now945pm). She tried to leave her backpack in our backyard and leave for this shelter with only the clothes she was wearing and her phone i noticed this as we were about to leave and it ended with her getting her backpack. There is still a paper shopping bag though with a bunch of socks in my backyard,theres a towel thats not ours, a large load of wet laundry in the washer thats also not ours,as i cant bend to reach into the washer right now as i fucked my back doing dishes i also found a notebook. Dunno what else I'll find she unpacked her entire back pack when she got here for some reason to charger her phone idfk. Im tossing anything of hers i find into a bag and putting it on the front porch with a note taped to it. That way if she comes back for her crap i dont even need to open the door. Im not letting her leave shit here as an excuse to come back. Im exhausted. At least im likely not the buttface 



Edit- yall i cant tell if im the butt face from advice tho its appreciated, but im kinda reading it as not the buttface though given whats being said, i seem to be in the right in this somehow correct me if im wrong please.

My wifes cousin ambushed me at my grandma inlaws. To summerize my post in the rant sub yesterday:
I said she could charge her phone it was getting near dark, by the time her phone was charged it was fucking frezing out and she asked if she could stay the night as she had a place to go in the morning. She gave me 50 bucks for the inconvenience.  So between that and the fact thay it was fucking cold i said yes cause i felt bad. 

Well its almost noon i had to wake her as i have an appointment later and errands to run. I explained that to her. I was getting ready amd she came in to my room and asked if she could possibly stay another night as she was having trouble finding a place to stay. I firmly said no and told her i was sorry.  Hell i even explained i was uncomfortable with someone i have only met three times being in the house whole i slept.

I feel bad for her i do. I am taking her wherever she wamts to be dropped pff in town. She asked if i could take her to another town 45 minutes away and i said no. I told her already i have things to do i cant drive thre and back and make it back in time for my appointment amd errands. Also it's not my car snd my mother in law has flat out told me im not allowed to take her car out of town.

And in the time it took to type this she has now started a load of laundry, our dryer doesnt work she knows this we told her last time she was here just a month ago, i feel like she is trying to buy herself time by pulling the ""but my clothes aren't dry"" card. She is that kind of person she did it to my mil last time she was here..she managed to get mil to let her stay almost a week.

Am i the buttface here for throwing her out? I dont trust her, i dont feel safe around her. She has tried offering me more money to stay again, if she has money to keep giving me she can go to a hotel or find a friend in town to pay to couch surf or go to one of the shelters.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-16T18:54:27.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit 2- she is gone!

"I (24f) have been with my gf (28f) for about two years. Within those two years we took about a three month break due to distance and job stresses. We recently just decided to get back together about 2 months ago

For some context in this whole scenario:

My gf loves concerts and is a big swiftie (buys tons of merch, goes to a lot of shows). I am a mild swiftie. My gf also has a best friend, Lucy (27f, fake name), who is the same level of swiftie as her.  Lucy also had a crush on my gf since they met 9 months ago. During our break, Lucy made some moves and they went on some dates. Since my gf and I got back together, she insists Lucy stay in her life as her best friend. I don’t like (or trust) it, but I deal with it

Now back to where the thing blows up:

I was on social media when I saw something about TS secret events she does. The poster asked who you +1 is if invited. I saw my gf had commented/tagged Lucy. It hurt but it was all hypothetical.

I guess I wasn’t carrying it well so my gf asked what was wrong. I admitted it didn’t make me feel okay that she would choose Lucy over me for an experience like that.

My gf said she didn’t understand why it would matter. I then told her it was a once in a life time experience, and as her gf I would want to experience that with her. Especially considering I’m also a fan of the artist. And as her partner, I felt like I should at least be offered first instead of glossed over.

My gf said since Lucy is a big fan like her, she would rather go with her. She told me I’m too reserved for her to be able to have fun and enjoy an experience like that. She said she should be able to choose who she’d have the better memory with.

I stood firm with my stance and told her how hurt I would be if she just ignored me and chose to go with Lucy instead. Especially since if it’s not TS it would be something else where it’s more realistic to happen.

My gf then said she would also choose Lucy for this sort of scenario, and it wasn’t right for me to make her choose between her gf and her best friend. I countered with the fact as a gf, I shouldn’t have to fight someone else for her attention.

I had enough since I keep my mouth shut about Lucy 90% of the time (for more context: they have 10+ concert trips planned this year AND going to europe for 3 weeks together)… but I had told her in the past eventually I’d have to put boundaries around the remaining 10% to protect my mental health/sanity.

And then I told her my boundary: if she openly chose Lucy for this without asking me first, I would almost immediately break up with her.

Of course this pissed off my gf bc she now just doesn’t have free reign with Lucy. Conversations about it have been no help since she’s now under the impression 90% free reign isn’t good enough and I gave her an ultimatum for the present: Me or Lucy.

She also openly admitted with this, she will be choosing Lucy.

So AITB for saying Lucy can’t always come before me?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-17T07:45:14.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (24f) have been with my gf (28f) for about two years.

"Recently there has been drama in my(14M) friend group(14-16) between two of our oldest members Paul(16M) and Jane(16F) they are in the same class together. Paul was my first friend in the group and strangely enough Jane and him never became friends until after they met me so right from the start something is a bit strange and even then Jane never considered Paul a friend but an associate.

this may not make any sense but Jane watches anime and likes to associate character stereotypes on to each of us for example she sees me as  ""cool guy"" and she sees Paul as the ""weakest and perverted""  everyone else get's positive stereotypes. not a day goes by where Jane is trying to project some false assumption onto Paul, she also likes to hit him for anything like not knowing a character name or not speaking properly or having an imagination. I have asked her many times to not hit Paul because that will lead to problems but she insists Paul is to baby to do anything. this has been going on for over a year.

Problems did arise however after Paul was having a really bad day, whenever something is bothering him he tends to keep away from us and go to his hiding place in school, I know where this place is so I went to check up on him, Jane did follow me as well as our other friends.  I don't understand but Paul's issue was he felt like a failure and needed time to adjust, Jane started to hit him with a book and told him to man up and the world doesn't revolve around him everyone told jane to stop but she kept going, I snatched the book from her but she resorted to using her hands, it was then Paul finally had enough and launched at Jane punching her once in the face, our other friends laughed because we have never seen Paul angry before like imagine a person who is always overjoyed at anything suddenly lose it. Jane cried and ran away.

Paul was suspended but when he came back Jane would avoid him like the plague causing our group to choose who to hang with, Paul told us it's okay to hang with Jane but Jane keeps complaining about Paul existence she would see him in the library and get mad she would see him go to the bathroom and get mad she even started to try and convince everyone to just drop him as a friend.

"I live with my partner and in the future we would like to buy a house. We said it will not happen for at least 3-4 years. My girlfriend has a help to buy ISA and was given a lump sum of £5000 from family. She has saved £1000 herself. 

I had money saved a few years ago but ended up spending it since I left work to look after a parent. Once I got back to work again I was on low paying jobs so didn't manage to save much. I have been in my current job for a year now and it's better paid so I have been able to start building my savings back up. 

I would like to get a safety net before I start saving for a house specifically. My partner knows this and knows how much I want to save. My partner kept going on for me to open an account specifically for saving for a house and to match her savings. I told her I would open the account but until I have my safety net, I'm not saving large amounts each month in this account. 

I told her how much I was planning to save and she said it was not enough and that I should save less towards my safety net and more towards the house. She mentioned that she is on less money than me and still manages to save more towards a house but I pointed out I have higher outgoings but she wouldn't listen. 

She said I'm clearly not serious and it's not unreasonable of her to tell me how much to be putting in and pointed out how much she has saved. I just reminded her that £5000 of hers came from family so she can't claim to have saved it herself and she said I was being unfair and should be saving more.

"Let me preface by saying I'm already in therapy for this , the thing is my boyfriend is a personal trainer and over the last year or so he has started posting content regularly on his personal social media and engaging with people from his gym regularly , specifically women he trains with and that leave flirty comments. 

We've been on a relationship for over two years (best friends for 3 on top of that) and he always avoids the topic of posting stuff indicating he's on a relationship despite him posting about everything else in the same social media accounts , not just related to his work but personal things as well.  

Now to the problem , he's started posting more risque photos of himself , that could be barely classified as 'physique photos/vids'' and the comments from women he interacts daily are super flirty to say the least , to the point where every time he gets close to me or tries to be affectionate the comments and flashbacks of his thirst traps flood my mind and make me severely disturbed. I can't shake this gut feeling and it's worsened to a degree where I have to hold back tears every time he tries to do something physical with me because it genuinely feels like I'm just an another ego booster to him and to me he looks like a public bathroom at that moment and I feel extremely guilty for thinking this and potentially sabotaging my relationship this way. My therapist only says I'm insecure but the road to actually fix this is not clear to me other than holding it in which my partner is able to tell ༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ.
 I've tried telling him some people's comments make me uncomfortable and he unfollows then to please me (I don't ask for that) but them follows them again after a while.

I’ve had a long stretch of mental issues post pandemic. I went to sixth form directly after for 2 years, and the whole time it was horrible, I skipped massive chunks of it and stayed to myself the whole time. Looking back I was to egoistic to even make an effort to make new friends and had to watch any old friends make new friends and memories. I was optimistic to start university in September 22 but didn’t I deferred my place without telling my parents and sat on my ass at home. I continuesly lied to them about starting later, all while having a huge depressive episode about having no friends and being lonely and scared to start.

During 2023 I got in contact with some people but ended up ignoring them again because I liked using them as a safety blanket without actually talking to them. And I made a shitload of posts on this sub about whenever my mum mentioned a bit of socialisation or having friends and taking it on as an attack. Not A lot but ALL  of you told me that I’m in the wrong and I seriously wished I listened. I lied about going to therapy then to people who commented on my post because for some strange reason I wanted to deeply know if my mum was stopping me progressing when I know for a fact she’s been supporting me all her life and even in those hard times last year and now. 

However I’ve started therapy in November end and it’s been great. I wish the sessions were longer. I’ve stopped winging at small things and I see the change of how I think in some ways. I can leave the house without my mum 90% of the time to the point I find it abnormal to stay at home the whole day. 

Now it’s January and the hard hitting truth of my lack of enjoyment after the pandemic (and it being  50% of my childhood missing due to anxiety shyness), I feel horrible I feel that I should’ve started University last September at the very least. I know many peers that did a 1 year late start. My parents are still very persistent and I can see their frustration about me not going to have a a job or the financial side of things. I have this really strong thought or feeling that my mum is to blame for me not starting last term but I’m trying my best to not go into that rabbit hole.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-16T19:28:19.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a long stretch of mental issues post pandemic.

"I (14F) was sitting on a train minding my own business 

I live in London so the trains go to places that aren’t very far way (This may affect your judgement) 

I was just playing music on the train as I always do, minding my own business 

Then this old man says “Excuse me, could you please turn the volume down?”

I tell him no and keep listening to my music, but then he walks up to me and asks me again and I tell him to mind his own business 

By this point his tone becomes a lot more aggressive 

“Listen, there are people on this train including me who don’t want to listen to your noise, use headphones or don’t play noise in the train”

I honestly don’t know what he wants to do with his life so I tell him 

“Did you pay for this entire train? No? Then fuck off and suck your mum, it’s a free country, you’re not a worker and by the looks of you, you can’t afford to pay to tell me what to do”

It was at this point someone else joined in to say 

“And you look like a stereotypical rich bitch who gets all her money from her father, you were clearly never told ‘no’ as a child”

I just glare at him and try to ignore him but I felt very embarrassed because of he commented on what I wear, especially since a few people laughed at me


I tell the old man “Look, I don’t care who backs you up, unless you paid for this entire train, I’ll play anything as loud as I want”

After he takes a seat further away from me along with another person, I get a call from my friend and I tell him what happened (That he started spitting in my face, bothering me and chatting shit) 

Even though I got onto a few sentences in, someone grabbed my phone and threw it out the door 

I quickly ran out the train to get it but the door to get it and just as I turned to get back on the train, the doors had closed and the guy who threw my phone out was laughing at me 

The old man saw this but just kept staring at me blankly 


Why do people think it’s okay to do that? Why didn’t anyone stand up for me?

"For a little context I'm in a relationship right now, Hes my same age and we go to the same school, but my mum keeps accusing me of ""showing myself off"" to him, for reasons i really dont understand because i've never and will never do things like that, no hate to anyone that does, but anyway.

Me: ""I wasn't naked again, and I dont do that I can show you my call logs again""

Mum: ""Still you shouldnt be basically naked in your room, you need to be ready for people to come in""

Me: ""I was ready for someone in my own family to come in, like if it was just charlie i could've thrown on a shirt while she was in my room because shes my sister"" 

Mum: ""If you want to continue this come upstairs to talk to me.""

Sooo i did and when i got upstairs i sat infront of my mum but she ignored me and didnt say anything so i started the conversation off with:

Me: ""I should be able to wear what i want in my room""

Mum: ""You need to be modest at all times, you have siblings that want to come in your room, and your dad"" 

Me: ""They should knock, It wouldve taken me 10 seconds to throw on a shirt, it's not like I was butt naked, plus its my room?""

Mum: ""I pay for this house, that room is mine your rooms about to be the downstairs lounge in a minute if you dont stop being disrespectful, then you'll have no privacy at all!""

Me: ""I feel like my room is my safe space, a place i dont have to be anything for anyone, I dont want to have to change that because of you wanting me to be modest at all times, you walk around in your garments and you're almost never decent in your room either?""

Mum: ""When have i ever done that?""

Me: ""a bunch of t-""

Mum: \*cuts me off\* ""There goes your victim complex again, I'm just your punching bag huh?"" 

At this point I was super over whealmed so i got up to leave for a little to cool down then come back but it didnt go well

Me: ""I need to cool off, I'll be back""

Mum: ""Leave your phone here""

Me: ""Why?""

Mum: ""So you cant go whining to your friends about how horrible your mother is"" 

Me: ""You do the same thing about me to dad? I hear you griping about me a lot""

Mum: ""You make me look bad to your friends, and make them hate me""

Me: ""I don't choose how they feel about you, I just tell them about how I feel about you after things happen"" 

Mum: ""Oh because you hate me soooo much""

Me: ""Sometimes I do get to that point, and i tell them that I hate you sometimes, but you do the same""

I walked away at that point and she was still shouting at me but i was ignoring her, later she came and took my phone away while i was on the phone with my best friend talking about what happened.

"I personally believe that human beings are (as the title says above) egotistical and self-centered, but not always in a bad way. I often hear words and phrases like “selfless”, “altruistic”, “putting other people’s needs above your own”, et cetera and I just roll my eyes because I think that’s just an illusion. I think people do what they do ultimately to serve themselves, regardless if their actions intentionally harm or benefit others. 

When I’m on social media like Reddit, Discord, hell sometimes even Instagram, I’m always seeing people being called out for having a big ego - but I bet the person calling them out has an equally if not bigger ego than they do, and wanted to feel good about themselves for putting someone else down. It makes sense, because people are more inclined to attack each other on social media because usually there’s little to no fear of retaliation compared to attacking someone in-person.

Let’s be honest with ourselves, we’re human beings and we all have egos, and our #1 goal in life is to serve and rely on ourselves. The one thing that we love and care about the most is ourselves, no matter who else in our lives we also love and care about. We will always put our needs before others. I’m not saying that we're incapable of caring about others and their needs (that’s the definition of selfishness/narcissism, not self-centeredness), but our needs will always be the #1 priority.

People often associate self-centeredness and egotism with bad things, but I think it’s directly related to good things too. People do both good and bad things for the same purpose: boosting their ego. For example, someone performs acts of kindness like volunteering or sending gifts to their friends because the positive feedback makes them think highly of themselves. One time I bought a cat-shaped stress ball for a friend who is a cat lover, and she loved it and gave me a hug. I bought it for her because I cared about her but it also made me feel good about myself especially when she hugged me. I mean, who wouldn't?

On the other hand, people may engage in dishonest, hurtful or even illegal behavior like gaslighting, bullying, blackmailing, et cetera because the feeling of wrongfully taking advantage of someone boosts their ego. It applies to people who commit atrocities as well, like mugging, assault, rape, murder, et cetera. I’m no criminal psychologist but we can’t deny that the potential notoriety resulting from them committing atrocities boosts their ego. Some people prefer to be feared rather than loved because they think it’ll boost their ego more than love would. A classic albeit fictional example would be Walter White, who committed atrocities to gain a reputation as a fearsome meth kingpin and to ultimately feed his pride and ego because he believed he would have otherwise died alone and forgotten. 

I would like to know if I’m a buttface and I’m wrong, or if I actually have a point. I’m curious about how much my beliefs resonate with others.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-16T19:22:41.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally believe that human beings are (as the title says above) egotistical and self-centered, but not always in a bad way.

&lt;p&gt;I would like to know if I’m a buttface and I’m wrong, or if I actually have a point. I’m curious about how much my beliefs resonate with others.&lt;/p&gt;

"I'm a teenager so this could be chalked up to me just being immature and not listening to my mum but this has been itching at me and I wanted to share.

&amp;#x200B;

Me (16F) and my mum (42F) got into an argument, this is what happened

&amp;#x200B;

I was sitting in my room drawing at my desk, wearing a sports bra that went down to my stomach and pj pants that went to my ankles when my sister, charlie (9) (fake name obviously) banged on my door, conversation went as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Sister: ""Isabella! (fake name for me) my friend wants to see your room!"" 

Me: ""No Charlie now's not a good time"" ( I didn't think I was dressed appropriately to have a random little girl i dont know come into my room)

Sister: \*no reply\*

Me: ""Charlie? I said no!""

I then heard her turning the door handle (I got my lock taken away by my mum a couple days prior) and the sound of the door opening, I screamed at her, ""NO GET OUT"" but she still tried walking into my room so i quickly got up and shoved the door closed in her face. 

A couple minutes later I decided to send a text to my mum explaining what happened in case my sister tried to get me in trouble again, the conversation over text went as follows:

Me: ""I just yelled at Charlie for trying to get into my room while im basically half naked with a random little girl, sorry for yellin""

Mum: ""Why were you half naked in your room?""

Me: ""It's my room..? and the door was closed?""

Mum: ""You should never be naked in your room, you need to always be ready to have someone walk in."" 

Me: ""I wasn't naked plus im not a open house i dont want to always be modest?""

Mum: ""Its just a little suspicious you're naked in your room with the door closed, are you on ft with your boyfriend while like that?"" continues in pt.2","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-15T11:03:11.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a teenager so this could be chalked up to me just being immature and not listening to my mum but this has been itching at me and I wanted to share.&lt;/p&gt;

"Last month, during New Year's Eve, my(38F) friend(35F) proposed a double date idea. The plan was to have a nanny take care of our children while we enjoyed our evening. She has two daughters, ages 3 and 6, and I have a 10-year-old son. Interestingly, my son and her 6-year-old are quite calm, but her 3-year-old can be quite a handful. The evening turned out to be wonderful. However, when it was time to pay the bills, my friend suggested I cover half of the nanny's fee. This left me pondering. Given that the nanny was primarily looking after her two younger children, and my son, who is older and less demanding, was there too, AITB to feel that her request was a bit unfair? I do appreciate her effort in organizing the evening, but I'm seeking an external opinion on the appropriate etiquette in this situation.

Couple of things to clarify:
I've already settled the amount my friend requested for the nanny's services.
I acknowledge that it would have been better to discuss this arrangement beforehand.
The nanny's charges were based on an hourly rate.
My spouse and I provided transportation for both couples to and from the venue in our vehicle, which didn't require extra fuel.

"I(16) and my friends(also 16) like to stop at this gas station near our neighborhood to get snacks. I will mention that before that day, no one had a problem with us being there.

I was looking for gum when I accidentally bumped into a Black lady. I apologized and moved on. She got pissed off and started screaming at me for being inconsiderate and accused me of doing it on purpose. I calmly told her it was an accident and went to the next section. She followed me and kept yelling at my friends and I for being rude, inconsiderate teens. 

This probably went on for about 5 minutes until an employee and two other customers told her to cool it. She didn't and when we were at the checkout she called us disgusting curry munchers and told us to ""go back to our country."" At that point, I told her to fuck off. She replied that what she said was true and that ""people like us"" were the reason the country was going to shit, and we were setting a bad image about our ethnicity. She was at the top of her lungs so I snapped back, ""Dude, you're the reason people think Black women are always pissed off, you cannot be yapping at us about positively portraying ethnicities."" She got red in the face but the cashier told her she had it coming.

"I work as a truck driver. I have a Monday - Friday job delivering to offices and warehouses. I also work the occasional Saturday at a different company delivering washing machines to people's houses. 

Usually this is fine but occasionally you have to endure pretty messy, smelly places. Last Saturday I experienced a new level of smell. I was carrying a washer into a house with my colleague, the smell was so bad it made me dizzy and I started wretching. I couldn't handle it so I ran outside and vomited twice. 

My colleague (who's been working this job for 30 years, and I assume this was why he was able to tolerate the smell) came out and berated me for refusing to help him. I told him I'm not going back in and I'd rather quit and get a taxi back home (we were 50 miles from my house and trust me i meant it) than go back in and face that demonic smell. Somehow he was able to handle the smell and finish the job alone while I waited outside, still heaving and feeling lightheaded. 

As I said this is just an occasional job I do as overtime, but is a 30 year career for my colleague. This is why I (retrospectively) understand his anger. I could easily quit and fall back on my 9-5, but if he got into trouble he could be losing his only income stream.

I look at her wondering why she’s not doing anything so I take matters into my own hands and pushed the dog with my leg and threw the leaves I was collecting at the dog when the lady pulled the leash away and said ‘’HEY!’’ So I looked at her and said ‘’get your dog’’ and she told my it was a free country and he can do what he wants or whatever so I just walked away.

"AITA for telling my bio dad that I want my mom(grandmother) to adopt me

Okay so for some context I’ve lived with my grandmother who I will be referring to as my mom for going on 10 years. My bio dad and my bio mom lost custody of me and my older sister due to them having drug addiction when I was around 5. The entire time I was with them I was never really taken care of or watch. They would both leave at day at a time and lock us out of the house, so we got to the point that we learned to keep the window to my older sister room unlocked just in case. There was just a lot of neglect but that’s a story for another day, so some I was in like 5th grade I’ve been wanting to tell him this but I never really had much reason for it. And recently I finally found it in me to tell him. My reasoning for this is because he’s never been a father too me for as long as I can remember and all of the things that he let happen to me under his watch he acted like wasn’t that big of a deal one of the biggest things being that he almost let my uncle kill me bc I walking in on them doing meth, so not a great start. Well here big the past 3 year since he got married his visits went from like 3-5 a week and lasting several hours to him visiting MAYBE once a week for 30 minutes to an hour. And for the past three months he’s only come over a max of 3-4 times. I know it might sound bratty but I really do want a relationship with him I just feel like he doesn’t want a relationship with me. Ever since he got married to his now wife and officially adopted her son I feel like I’m just a second priority that he might pay his child support to if he wants. Before he got married he was always over here and genuinely tried to connect with us but it really damaged our relationship after he got married to her and I didn’t find out about it until 3 days later. I know that I can’t be too priority because he is married and has an obligation to her but I know she doesn’t like me and that doesn’t bother me but he has missed all except for 2 of my XC and track meets combined bc he was at her kids gymnastics or karate I just fill like I was put in last place. He is Ben almost missed my beta induction bc he forgot and took his wife to a nail appointment. I wouldn’t mind it so bad but I haven’t been able to do one thing with just him me and my older sister since he got married . I think it’s also important to jot that I’ve been calling her mom for the past year and he yelled at me in front of my friends how it was weird and that I better not be calling her husband dad because he wasn’t my dad he was. After I told him that I wanted my mom to adopt me and that I wasn’t going to change my mind he said and I quote I will pray that you never need anything from me bc if you do I’m not going to be helping.

"My boyfriend and I are long distance and see each other once a month. Recently, he flew to see me and on our last day, his return flight got delayed a few hours, so he texted me to ask whether I wanted to come downtown and spend a few extra hours together once I got off of work.

The next day, he told me that he was disappointed that I didn’t want to spend the extra time with him before his flight. He said that it made him feel unloved because we only see each other once a month, and it takes a lot of effort to spend time together, so it makes him feel unimportant. I told him that was not true, that I did care. I told him that I would have enjoyed hanging out during his return flight delay, but that logistically it didn’t make much sense.

" I,   33yo female, canceled my wedding this year 2 weeks before the date.   We  were already legally married (1 yr) but most people didn't know that  as  we did it in secret.  After getting legally married to my husband,  25yo  male who was a few years in the USA, I got a girl  follow me on IG  who had a highlight with my husband of at least 10  pictures and videos  together.  One of the picture she dressed in all  white, he in suite,  and the caption read ""She said Yes!"" which made me  think he was already  married in his country.  He explained to me he did a  ceremony to be  able to get to know a girl in his country but then moved  to the USA and  that ended.  I chose to trust him and we moved forward  with wedding  plans but he was always in a bad mood seeing venues and  speaking of  wedding stuff.  He struggled to keep up with payments for  that and our  living expenses which I found odd due to him working over  time weekly  at a reasonably paid job as a chef.  He explained he had a  big debt in  his country from a restaurant he had opened in the past that  closed  down (a debt he previous to getting married said would finish  paying  January 2023 but later turned out to be ongoing all year long).

1.5-2   months before the wedding date we argued over wedding stuff (guest  list  being at 100 instead of 80) and his mood at wedding final walk  through  (again being shitty).  He said I make everything complicated  and it's  all my fault.  I said maybe your right, in tears, and I am  complicated  and thus maybe we shouldn't of even gotten married in the  first place.   After this, he became a completely different person and  said needed  space- began sleeping in another room, would tell me not to  touch him,  when I tried to talk to apologize/fix the situation (at  least 5  conversations) it would lead nowhere as I felt he was cold and  not open  to fixing things (just defensive and not listening to my  side).  The  more time passed by the more anxious and desperate I became  as we were  so close the wedding and this was ongoing.  I offered  therapy and he  refused and said he would only talk to my father about  this.  My husband  then told me his mother had a stroke and was in the  hospital but  cognitively ok.  Due to everything going on, I didn't even  know if to  believe that.  However, I can't prove anything so I offered  to post pone  the wedding and/or help him pay for a flight ticket to go  see her.  He  said no to both.  He wanted to go on with the wedding but  not really  clear the air with me in time for the date.  I involved my  dad, wrote  him a two page front and back letter, cleaned his room, had  my sister  talk to us until finally he and I seemed to fix things.  But  during all  of that he belittled me, yelled at me for 40 minutes  straight, would  scold/demand that I not cry.

"I (late teens) want my mum to leave her husband (nicknamed S). For context they had separated a few months ago because S had not improved at all for years, he used to be an alcoholic until he put his fist through a door because my mum asked him to stop hitting the door, S replied with I'm headbutting the door then showd what punching the door sounds like and put a dent in it. In his defence he hasn't picked up a drink in at least 3 years.

Last year about July they separated and decided to be in different rooms in the house because of S not improving or doing anything beyond playing games and doing a few chores (cleaning the floors, cleaning bathrooms, doing laundry, and a few other things.) I have school on the weekends I have to mow the lawn on week days I have to walk the dogs 3 times, do the dishes in the morning and night, clean the kitchen morning and night, feed the dogs, and if I don't I get yelled at by S for not doing the chores and get tolled to get up earlier in the morning so that I can do the chores.

While my mum and S were separated my mum told me she didn't feel safe telling S how he made her feel, how she found him unattractive, how he was showing all these red flags, she even told me that while they were separated he went through her messages and emails and got mad at her for flirting with a other guy even though they said that they were not together in any way, in that same vain he also said that he didn't like that she had told her friends about what was going on.

Within the last week she told me that she was thinking of getting back with him I asked her why and she said that she didn't want to lose the friendship because of it (it is a friendship longer than I've been alive) and how she dosent want to stay with him for tax stuff (I live in AUS so that is a thing for most people) she also doesn't want to stay with him because he owns the block because he was the only one in the house that could get a loan because of covid. In this conversation she also said that they wouldn't be moving into the same room but the past 3-4 nights he has slept in the room with her. She also said that she is proud that he is improving now (now that she threatened to take his easy living away) he has improved by finding a guy that he does airtasker jobs for and makes like 1000 aud a week on a good week. My mum makes over 1000 a day at her job.

The whole point of this is because I'm autistic and have ADHD and I want to make sure that I'm not the only one that thinks that it shouldn't be this way. I also don't know what to do if it is this is a reasonable thought to have on my part. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Throw away because I don't want this on my main

I (35m) moved to Ireland 1st of November 2023 and have been living here since. I've been on a room in a house in which the landlord lives. One day I was coming home from Tesco (a grocery store), when I came in the door my landlord's dog jumped up on me and made me almost drop the bag of groceries I was holding so I pushed the dog away and hit her on the nose.

Then my landlord walked in as I was shouting at the dog and ran over to me and asked what happened. I explained what happened and that he needs to train his dog to not attack people. He then started to get mad at me and I got nervous and lied and told him the dog bit me. He then told me his dog would never and asked my to show him the bite marks... so I panicked and told him to fuck off and that I fucked his mom and that he has no right to see any part of my body and then I left got in my car and went back to Tesco.

"So all of this began when in june 2022 when both of us were in 10th grade, I (16M) confessed my feelings to my best friend at that time(I liked him). He is also 16M and he knew I am gay. It all started in June ending when I confessed over text and because I knew he was straight I asked if he could not contact me for few weeks so that I could get over my feelings and not ruin our friendship. And that I did by mid July I was over my feelings and felt nothing for him and everything was back to normal. But was it? It was around august ending both of us were seated in a cafe near our tution (we had a friend group and all of us used to go to a cafe near our tution before the actual tution began. But that day only the two of us were present) and he out of the blue said I like you (as in he liked me). For a second I was shocked but then things got a bit awkward and I brushed it off because I did not want to ruin our friendship. But September 6 all of our friend group had gone to a mall nearby to hangout and at the end 4 people were left and 2 of them were best friends so they seperated from us and then me and him were left. And all of a sudden he started saying that why are you acting like this and that he had already said that he liked me. To which I reply ""do you even understand what you're saying"" And ""I request that you please go home and think about this because we are best friends"". But then days passed and he said nothing and acted like nothing happened. And one day around September ending he calls me and says I was pranking you and did not like you. Honestly speaking that hurt, it hurt bad. I couldn't understand the fact that who streches out a prank this serious for a whole month. So after things between us got quite awkward and I confronted him one day with all this and all he said was I'm sorry. We did not talk to for a few months up until may 2023 (which is when I found out he was leaving the country and moving abroad). After that we were friends again and he left the country in September 2023 and we kept in touch and talked for hours on the phone. But all the time we talked all we talked about was a girl he had liked before leaving and 2 girls who had rejected him in the past and admitted their feelings just before he left. And 2 out of these 3 girls are in a relationship right now. And I kid you not when I saw he used to call me everyday just so he could get to know what these couples were doing and had they broken up. He used to say that if I wanted I could break these couples up easily. And honestly I was done with this shit. So on jan 8 2024 I texted him a whole ass paragraph about how he had hurt me and that a sorry could not undo things and that the ""prank"" He played was awful and that all our conversations were about these 3 girls and I could not deal with this anymore.

"this happened a while ago but has resurfaced as of recent, I 16F (at the time) am a part of a large friend group full of (now) all girls, My friend N (codename), 16F, is a large character in our group and acts as a buffer for a lot of the quieter ones within. N has a habit of acting like the world revolves around her when it doesn't, this bothers a lot of the other girls in the group but for the friendships sake we all tolerate her behavior.

My other friend S, 16M, joined the group for a short amount of time a few months ago. N didn't have a problem with him at all, in fact, she used him and I to get closer to a girl he knows in the year above us - lets call her O. I knew from the very beginning that she was using us but S still believed that she was doing this with no other intentions.

I won't lie and say that I haven't felt annoyed at times with S, he's a louder person and likes to be touchy at times. I'm not a very touchy person and that's no fault of his but I had enough of being clung to and confided in N with that information. She took that as me HATING S. which i don't.

O, N's crush, was a part of a group that S was also in. I didn't like that group because they made S the butt of the joke every time and I could see he didn't like it. N spoke to me for advice on talking to O as i was also a part of that other group at the time, I told her to take everything she says with a pinch of salt as she can have an attitude at times.

N thought it was for the best to complain about S to me, I called her out on it as I didn't approve of her talking badly and insulting my friend to me. Now, I admit I talked about S behind his back but I said nothing bad about him as he is a close friend of mine - all i spoke about was that some of his actions made me uncomfortable at the time.

N said that S made her uncomfortable and that he clung onto her and that she thinks he has a crush on her. (All things that he did to ME.) she wanted ME to talk to him and kick him out of the group, saying that all of the other girls didn't like him either, despite inviting him to their birthday parties and openly talking to him outside of school hours.

I told N to get a grip and that it wasn't my responsibility to kick out my own friend when I wasn't the one who had an issue with him.

N has a habit of acting like the world revolves around her when it doesn&amp;#39;t, this bothers a lot of the other girls in the group but for the friendships sake we all tolerate her behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other friend S, 16M, joined the group for a short amount of time a few months ago. N didn&amp;#39;t have a problem with him at all, in fact, she used him and I to get closer to a girl he knows in the year above us - lets call her O. I knew from the very beginning that she was using us but S still believed that she was doing this with no other intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t lie and say that I haven&amp;#39;t felt annoyed at times with S, he&amp;#39;s a louder person and likes to be touchy at times. I&amp;#39;m not a very touchy person and that&amp;#39;s no fault of his but I had enough of being clung to and confided in N with that information. She took that as me HATING S. which i don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O, N&amp;#39;s crush, was a part of a group that S was also in. I didn&amp;#39;t like that group because they made S the butt of the joke every time and I could see he didn&amp;#39;t like it. N spoke to me for advice on talking to O as i was also a part of that other group at the time, I told her to take everything she says with a pinch of salt as she can have an attitude at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N thought it was for the best to complain about S to me, I called her out on it as I didn&amp;#39;t approve of her talking badly and insulting my friend to me. Now, I admit I talked about S behind his back but I said nothing bad about him as he is a close friend of mine - all i spoke about was that some of his actions made me uncomfortable at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N said that S made her uncomfortable and that he clung onto her and that she thinks he has a crush on her. (All things that he did to ME.) she wanted ME to talk to him and kick him out of the group, saying that all of the other girls didn&amp;#39;t like him either, despite inviting him to their birthday parties and openly talking to him outside of school hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told N to get a grip and that it wasn&amp;#39;t my responsibility to kick out my own friend when I wasn&amp;#39;t the one who had an issue with him. N talked to S and S was formally kicked out of the group, he felt hurt and betrayed that someone he trusted did that to him.

"I have no idea how to do an update so I thought I would do this here instead and hope the people that were interested see it. The police came round the other day and asked me some follow up questions and I showed them the camera footage that I had and they asked what I want out of the situation. I told them that I don’t want any action taken yet and I just wanted a record of it incase anything else happened. I wrote a letter to ND’s mum(M) and had the postman post it for me, the letter was me explaining what had been happening and my concerns and asking if there was anything she could do to prevent anything else happening. 

M knocked on an hour ago asked if she could have a quick chat and I went out to talk to her, she was very apologetic as she had no idea any of this was going on. She explained that ND has a lot of learning difficulties as well as OCD, so ND is very anxious about doors, windows and gates being open and he believes that someone will break in if anything is left open. Which makes the constant harassment about closing the gate make sense and I said that we will do our best to keep it closed to not cause him any unnecessary stress.

M said she had no idea that ND had been coming into my garden and looking in through the windows, she apologised and said she will talk to ND and explain boundaries with him so that he understands and she will make sure it doesn’t happen again. She was completely understanding of why I was scared and reacted the way that I did and said if it had been her in the same situation she would of been terrified and called the police straight away so she was very appreciative that I was patience and understanding.

Im very happy with this outcome and hope that nothing else happens. M is a lovely lady and I appreciate her coming to talk, she liked the letter as it reminded her of when she used to send letters to her friends before they passed away. She said even though the letter wasn’t pleasant to read it brought back warm feelings for her. We have agreed that if I ever need to communicate with her then I will write her a letter, so it looks like I have a pen pal now which is sweet.

This goes a lot deeper so I've tried to summarise.

There are 5 siblings ages 44M, 38F, 35M, 27F and 24F. 44M has a different dad. 38F and 35M share a dad. 27F and 24F share a dad. My mum got remarried last august to her ex husband, the father of 38F and 35M. He's well off, our dad is not and will probably leave us nothing as he doesn't own property and has a young daughter to think about.

Our mum and her husband recently arranged their will's so 24F, 27F and 44M would get her small 2 bed house and the others would get his more expensive bungalow. My mum had asked me what I thought of this and I said it seemed fair but I wouldn't mind if we were all on her two bed because I didn't think our siblings would kick us out me (24) and my sister (27) live there.

Our older sister 38F was mad that I was asked even in passing about it because it's her dad but my mum was asking from her perspective. Every time she's tried to discuss it with my sister she's said she doesn't want to talk about it because it's dark.

38F found out and was furious saying that they should be on my mum's house too. Which would mean that they get around £80,000 each and 27 and 24F (me) get £24,000.
She called me evil for working out the money but I only did it to see if that's why she was mad because I thought it seemed fair. She says that she's fee' unloved if my mum's house wasn't split betwee 5 siblings and it's not about money. Am I the Asshole?

"Thankyou for your feedback guys. The conclusion has come that I am TBF and I won't stop picking her up or getting offended over 1 comment. Thankyou very much for putting things in prospective. We had a meeting after my boyfriend picked his kids up about her attitude towards me and me overreacting to her comment. I decided to apologize for overreacting and decided to laugh off any comments or play along next time. I decided to make the personal servant comment into a joke because when my boyfriend and I went to pick up the children, I rolled the window down and said ""Your person servant's here to pick you up"". This made the kids laugh and they entered in the car.


When we arrived home, we had the meeting about Kourtney calling me her personal maid and me overreacting. I apologized for overreacting and she told me it's ok. She didn't speak to me but that's ok because as long as she's safe and happy then that's all that matters and I put my feelings aside for the sake of the children. I decided to bake chocolate cupcakes for my family since my sister, BIL, niece and my parents were coming to visit. The children loved the cake, especially my boyfriends son who tried to sneak another cake thinking I wouldn't notice, but that's ok since we were all having a good time. Overall, we had a good time and went to watch football the next day aswell. Everyone had a good time overall as I turned the personal servant into a inside joke and said jokatively ""the personal servants here to serve her masters chocolate cupcakes"". 


I love learning from my mistakes and make the best of any situation that comes towards me. I am blessed to have a good weekend with my boyfriend and his children.

"I have been with my partner for nearly 6 years now. We're talking about having children in the next few years. Neither of us really care about getting married so we have different surnames and even if we do get married my partner will be keeping her surname. 

We were discussing children last night and she mentioned that any children we have will have her surname. I told her that's a decision we make together and since we have different surnames, the best thing to do is to have a double-barrelled/hyphenated surname. 

She refused that since she said she doesn't like how they look and said it will be her name they get. I again reminded her that she doesn't unilaterally get to decide whose name our child gets and that it is only right for them to have both our names

She said I wasn't listening to her and that I should just leave it since she's made her mind up and I again pointed out she doesn't seem to realise it will be my child just as much as hers and it's not right to not also give the child my surname.

"I have been with my partner for 5yearsand we have been engaged for around 8 months now. When we got engaged we didn't really have a lot of time to start planning the wedding straight away and both of us were fine being engaged for a year or two. 

We've now started sitting down to start planning the wedding and my partner mentioned last night that she doesn't want to take my surname at the wedding. I asked what she planned to do and she said just keep her own. I mentioned that it would be a bit weird to be married and have separate surnames still so I suggested we both take each others name and have a double barrelled surname since then it won't just be her taking my name and it will be a nice gesture. 

She refused and said it was an outdated tradition that she doesn't want to take part in. I asked what her problem was with us both taking the others surname and she just said she shouldn't have to and that I'm out of line for trying to pressure her into it. My point was just that it's what happens at a wedding and I understand her not wanting to get rid of her name completely but I don't see why it has to be an issue for us to take each others name. 

She just repeated that I'm wrong for trying to force her to do it and that I should drop it.

"Ok so let me (37m) start by saying that we have had a small pause in our relationship a month before this happened.
That had more to do with me wanting to take things slow, I have kids, a good job and a nice house.
Meanwhile she (34f) didn't have kids, was unemployed and unwilling to move to my area.
I was prepared to move but I really didn't feel like dropping everything within the first year of our relationship if she wasn't going to meet halfway.
She did end up finding a job

So last week she was late for her new job so I didn't get to talk to her in the morning and as we were busy all day I basically couldn't contact her.
I had a meeting with some other parents from my kids school
With my daughter's birthday coming up I decided to meet with my ex (we are on good terms) in a coffee shop nearby before the meeting to discuss her birthday.

I sit my ass down and my gf finally sends a message and I tell her exactly what the plan is and that iam with my ex.
My girlfriend just sends 2 texts: ""WTF"" and ""ok""
I try to contact her afterwards and the next morning because I knew she probably was jealous but I got nothing back at all.

For the next 1.5 days I receive not a single word and by that time I already decided that if she wanted to talk about this she had enough time to do so.
So I finally confront her basically going in with the fact knowing that this would end but I gave her the time to talk about things.
She told me that she doesn't know how to deal with my kids because of my ex and vice versa.
So I told her that if she gets between me and my ex if we have a conversation about our kids you are actually coming between me and my kids and that's a line I wouldn't let her cross and finally that she crossed a line when she just vanished without saying a word.

So she said she probably wouldn't be able to deal with my demands and I told her that it's over.
Since then she has became very apologetic and wants me back.
I think I did the right thing but iam still wondering if I could have handled this differently perhaps.
She's an amazing person otherwise but I can't keep dealing with her mood swings.

She&amp;#39;s an amazing person otherwise but I can&amp;#39;t keep dealing with her mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tldr, gf jealous of my ex because I met her to discuss my daughters birthday, gf just vanished and I decided that I couldn&amp;#39;t deal with that.&lt;/p&gt;

"My bf recently moved states for work and is in town visiting me. He’s been staying in a hotel because his family dynamic isn’t good and he doesn’t want to stay with them.

I live with my family, otherwise I would offer him to stay with me. 

On his first day back to visit, we were hanging out and then he dropped me home around midnight. He was contemplating where to stay for the night and was parked outside my house while trying to figure it out. He was debating staying in his car overnight atp. I let him know that if he sleeps in his car, he cannot stay parked outside my house all night bc my dad would think it’s very odd to see him there when he leaves for work early in the morning.

He understood and I went to sleep. I randomly woke up at 2 am and saw him still outside. I tried calling him but he didn’t answer, so I went out there to find him asleep in his car. I had to knock on the window to wake him up and ask him why he was still there. He said he accidentally fell asleep. I told him he needed to go. He got upset and started asking if I was hiding something. He questioned if I had gone out during those two hours of him sleeping. I said no and he eventually left.

A couple days later he visited me during my lunch break at work. He was working remote that day and was doing meetings at the library before seeing me. However after dropping me at work, he went and bought some food and came back to the parking lot of my work. He didn’t tell me he was coming back but I saw him pulling in. I went outside to ask what he was doing and he said he was just going to eat lunch/work there bc he didn’t know where else to go and wanted to be close to a bathroom. 

I told him I felt like he was spying on me and he said no and it was weird that I would assume that and that me saying that makes him feel like I’m hiding something. I asked him to please leave and he said no bc he had a right to be in that parking lot. He said I should appreciate that he wants to be close to me and should be more considerate that he can’t stay with his family while trying to visit me.

"My girlfriend and I enjoy going to pub quizzes at a specific bar. Sometimes the quizzes are for something my girlfriend has an interest in but I don't and vice versa. There was one quiz that I was really excited about and was looking forward to for weeks.

It came to the night of the quiz and we got there early and had a couple of drinks. The seating for the bar is fairly long benches meant to seat 8 people so we had a lot of space on ours. The quiz was sold out which meant people joined out table since the bar was full. After3 questions of the quiz my girlfriend stands up and says she can't stay there and that we need to go. 

I ask why and she said she doesn't like how busy it is so we leave. She then asks if I'm annoyed and I say of course I am since she knew how much I was looking forward to it and left before it had even properly began. She then said she can't help being anxious but I pointed out she doesn't seem to get anxious being around a lot of people when it's for something she wants to do since she's been to a lot of concerts last year and other busy events. 

She said that's not fair and said we could go again but I just pointed out that most of that bars quizzes are getting sold out so I'm not going to go to another one to just have a repeat of this one. She accused me of being uncaring but I just said it seems convenient that her anxiety plays up when it's an event I want but doesn't affect her at all when it's something she wants.

"I have been with my girlfriend for around a year now and I have met quite a few of her friends and I get on well with them. My girlfriend had plans to go to her friends house, lets call her Nicola for a few drinks and then go into town to a bar and club with her friend and another of Nicolas friends, lets call her Olivia. My girlfriend mentioned that I was invited if I want to come along since I haven't met this friend yet so I agreed. 

When we got there her friend immediately said hello to my girlfriend and said nothing to me despite me saying hi. We brought drinks and she offered my girlfriend a glass for hers but again didn't even acknowledge that I was there. Olivia was polite and at least made an effort to speak to me. 

Nicola kept talking to my friend about people and events that happened long before me and my girlfriend knew each other so I couldn't join in the conversation and as soon as my girlfriend filled me in on the details, Nicola would change the subject. This went on for the rest of the night. 

The next morning my girlfriend asked what I thought of Nicola and I was honest and said I found her rude. I pointed out she made absolutely no effort to even speak to me despite me trying to make an effort and pointed out she went out of her way to exclude me from conversations. 

My girlfriend said I was being unfair and that she wasn't bad and she'd done nothing wrong. I just pointed out that my gf had asked for my opinion and that I was only being honest. I mentioned that I like the rest of her friends but Nicola just seemed rude for no reason.

"I have been with my partner for 3 years and for the last 2 years we have gone on holiday in the summer. We live in the UK so like to pick destinations in Europe. Our first holiday was to a city that was also known for it's beaches so we split our time between looking around the city and sitting on the beach. 

I would rather be looking around the city and I am not a fan of the beach at all but sicne it was a holiday for both of us, we compromised which I was fine with. For our holiday last year we were supposed to go on a city break as there were 2 cities both me and my gf wanted to see so we were going to go to both of them. 

When it came to booking the trip (everything was already picked out) my girlfriend changed her mind and instead said she wanted a relaxing beach holiday. I wasn't a fan of the idea but my gf promised that we would have a city break for our next holiday and said that she would just want a relaxing trip this time. 

We ended up going to a beach resort and spent most of the time by the pool or on the beach so I was bored most of the time. We want to book our summer holiday early this year so we can plan other things around it so we started looking this week. I mentioned the cities we were supposed to go to last year and my gf said no. I mentioned a couple of other cities but she said no to them. 

I asked what cities she's thinking of then and she just said she'd prefer a hot holiday near the beach. I reminded her of her promise last year and she said she knows and she's sorry but she wants another beach holdiay.

I refused and said we either go on a nice city break together or we're not going away together this year. she accused me of giving her an ultimatum but I just reminded her that I compromised for her on what she wanted last year so its only right she does the same for me. She refused and said she shouldn't have to and that we go on holiday to relax and she doesn't want to look around a city. 

I pointed out that she had clearly lied to me last year just to get what she wants then but she told me I was wrong. I just repeated that I won't be going on a beach holiday so we either look at city breaks or we're not going away and she accused me of being unreasonable.

she asks if she's not worthy enough for me to send her videos instead of my friend and i respond telling her the videos i send to my friend and the videos that i send to her are just two different humors that she may not get. she goes on this long rant that consists mainly of her telling me that ""don't send him things that are funny if you can send them to me instead"" and ""i am the most important so you should think of me first instead of your friends"", and while i do regard her as the most important person in my life i dont agree that i should only think of her because well thats just not realistic.

she then proceeds to completely blow the situation out of the water claiming that i dont love and how she isnt enough why she isnt first etc. 

this isnt the first time she does something like this either not even for this reason just little things like me not wanting to do something and when i dont she will start to cry and make me feel bad until i agree or say yes to whatever she wants. i find this as really controlling and have brought it up to her how i feel and she just disregards it telling me shes not controlling. im not really happy in this relationship with her and to be completely honest in the 5 months that i've been with her its been really disappointing to find out her true colors.

" As some background: my ex and I got pregnant about a year and a half into our relationship. I already had a decent savings, but I saved up to 15k while I was pregnant just to have some cushion because I planned on being a stay-at-home mom. Things ended between him and I around the time our child was 5 months old due to domestic violence. It was a very scary and traumatic time, but over the last 2 years he pursued therapy and he seems to be doing better now and our kid is happy to see him. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents opened up their home to me and when I first moved in I mentioned needing to find a job so I could contribute and they told me it wouldn't be necessary and they wanted me to be a stay-at-home mom for my child because it was important for us to bond. So, I pursued therapy so I could work through the traumatic breakup, worked a very small work-from-home part-time gig for my parents (it relates to the career path I want to be on), and enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom. I've been using my savings to provide for my child. The only things I don't pay for are utilities, garbage, and rent. I've checked in multiple times over the last two years and every time they tell me they're happy to help &amp; to not worry about it. My kiddo is now 2.5 years old and I only have 3k\~ in my savings which is the lowest it's been in probably a decade. So, I decided this was going to be the year to apply for pre-school scholarships or send her to a low-cost daycare. I got the scholarship accepted for my kiddo and preschool starts next week. I plan to work a bit more (not full-time, but enough to replenish my savings) and finish my degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly have been hung up on low-cost daycares because a man I used to go study with in college was working in a state-funded daycare and he followed a ton of porn accounts on Instagram of My Little Pony, so that + following people with families... Like, the dude is watching MLP porn and then a family photo pops up next on his feed? Isn't that how people get desensitized to new fetishes? Maybe it's my anxiety talking and I'm being judgmental, but I did not want my child to be anywhere near a person who could just simply get some easily attainable certifications and be watching my kid when he has a ton of children-show porn popping up on his Instagram feed. And the average cost of daycare in my area is anywhere between 2k-4k a month. I wouldn't be able to afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

But my mom was just talking to me and said how my aunt thinks I should have thrown my kid into daycare sooner and worked full-time. And my mom was telling me ""she's so hard on you when we talk, but I just don't think I could do that to you,"" My aunt's comment bothers me a little but I do appreciate the honesty (though she has never actually talked to me about it).

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't know. I feel weird lol. I'm just curious what others would say though.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-11T22:11:52.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As some background: my ex and I got pregnant about a year and a half into our relationship.

&lt;p&gt;My parents opened up their home to me and when I first moved in I mentioned needing to find a job so I could contribute and they told me it wouldn&amp;#39;t be necessary and they wanted me to be a stay-at-home mom for my child because it was important for us to bond. So, I pursued therapy so I could work through the traumatic breakup, worked a very small work-from-home part-time gig for my parents (it relates to the career path I want to be on), and enjoyed being a stay-at-home mom. I&amp;#39;ve been using my savings to provide for my child. The only things I don&amp;#39;t pay for are utilities, garbage, and rent. I&amp;#39;ve checked in multiple times over the last two years and every time they tell me they&amp;#39;re happy to help &amp;amp; to not worry about it. My kiddo is now 2.5 years old and I only have 3k~ in my savings which is the lowest it&amp;#39;s been in probably a decade. So, I decided this was going to be the year to apply for pre-school scholarships or send her to a low-cost daycare. I got the scholarship accepted for my kiddo and preschool starts next week. I plan to work a bit more (not full-time, but enough to replenish my savings) and finish my degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly have been hung up on low-cost daycares because a man I used to go study with in college was working in a state-funded daycare and he followed a ton of porn accounts on Instagram of My Little Pony, so that + following people with families... Like, the dude is watching MLP porn and then a family photo pops up next on his feed? Isn&amp;#39;t that how people get desensitized to new fetishes? Maybe it&amp;#39;s my anxiety talking and I&amp;#39;m being judgmental, but I did not want my child to be anywhere near a person who could just simply get some easily attainable certifications and be watching my kid when he has a ton of children-show porn popping up on his Instagram feed. And the average cost of daycare in my area is anywhere between 2k-4k a month. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to afford it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my mom was just talking to me and said how my aunt thinks I should have thrown my kid into daycare sooner and worked full-time. And my mom was telling me &amp;quot;she&amp;#39;s so hard on you when we talk, but I just don&amp;#39;t think I could do that to you,&amp;quot; My aunt&amp;#39;s comment bothers me a little but I do appreciate the honesty (though she has never actually talked to me about it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I don&amp;#39;t know. I feel weird lol. I&amp;#39;m just curious what others would say though.&lt;/p&gt;

"Yesterday, my boyfriend (21M) and I (19F) had a huge argument. My boyfriend can occasionally get possessive and jealous easily, which never really bothered me, but yesterday's conversation took an unexpected turn. 

He had questioned if I held hands with my female friends. I’m bisexual, so I can tell that he was suspicious about my closeness to them. I explained I held hands with them occasionally in crowded areas or when walking alone at night. 

Though he didn’t say it, I could tell he was upset. I emphasized that physical touch isn't always romantic, especially between girls. Women holding hands, even women who are attracted to other women doesn’t necessarily imply romantic attraction. I also shared my concerns about safety as a woman. Holding hands with each other in sketchy places helps us feel safer. Though not condemning all men, I explained I have a general fear of being alone with a man or crowds of men since I had been sa’d before. He responded, suggesting I was overly fearful, comparing my caution to common stereotypes about women. “You’re acting like every man is going to kidnap you. You say you aren’t judgemental of people but you’re like every other woman on the subject of men.” 

Me being offended by that, I asked what that was supposed to mean. He then went on to say, “The way you say it it seems like you’d be terrified of me if you didn’t know me.” I told him I wouldn’t be terrified of him individually, it’s a general thing. I told him not only is he and most other men physically stronger and bigger than I am it’s just a common occurrence for women to be sa’d since statistically speaking, 1 out of 4 women will experience it in their lifetime. I, being the one out of four, am terrified of it happening again. I don’t fear every man. I fear every man I don’t know and don’t trust. 

The conversation escalated when he raised unrelated hypothetical scenarios and questioned the validity of women's assault claims. Saying things like, “So you think a guy is sexually harassing you if he tries to walk past in a crowd and accidentally grazes your ass???” And “It’s just so many women will let a guy have sex with her and then say it’s rape. So many guys are wrongly accused.” Feeling hurt and accused of exaggerating my own experience, I've been distant since. 

He’s called and texted me several times, saying he understands why he upset me and he’s sincerely sorry. Despite his numerous apologies, I'm struggling to forgive him, particularly because he diverted the discussion away from my genuine fear and experience in order to make a point. This wasn’t supposed to be an argument. It was supposed to be me telling him how I felt. AITBF for not forgiving him after a sincere apology?

TLDR; Boyfriend questioned my fear of men after a past sa, dismissed safety concerns because he felt personally attacked, and diverted the conversation to stereotypical and uncommon scenarios of women lying for attention. Despite apologies, I'm struggling to forgive him. AITBF for not forgiving him after a sincere apology?

UPDATE: I appreciate everyone’s input. I decided to fully reveal to my boyfriend exactly how I was feeling. I basically took this post and directed it towards him. I still don’t know what I’m going to do with whether or not I’m going to stay with him. However he recently just said this to me:

“I'm sorry for what I said; I really am. I didn't mean to direct everything towards you. I guess I was just trying to make my own opinions more valid than yours. Yes, I know I shouldn't. It was more of a defensive thing, and I'm sorry. I truly do love you, and I'm sorry for upsetting you; that wasn't my intention. I understand why you're fearful of them, considering I've had a similar experience with the opposite sex. I really am sorry. I love you so much.”

I’m pained to say this only made me decision harder. I can’t tell if this was a one-off thing. I’m wondering only apologizing so I won’t leave, or if he’s apologizing because he’s sincerely sorry.

First of all thank you for all the reply’s on the previous post. Most of them were super helpful in figuring out how I wanted to continue.

It’s been a bit of a week.

The day after I posted I sat down with my wife. I told her that my relationship with sex feels unhealthy right now and I’d like to take a break from it for a little while. It was a long, mostly one sided conversation. I asked her if we could reconvene a month from now and see how we both feel. She agreed. 

Edit: should mention that one of the main points of criticism I received on the last post was that ultimatums will not work and are unhealthy. I just want to make it clear that’s not what I did here. 

My honest takeaway from this conversation was that it didn’t make me feel any better because she didn’t seem to care. She didn’t seem to care about not having sex, and she didn’t seem to care how I was feeling about it.

For most of the week after we talked I actually felt pretty good about it. I reached out to multiple local therapists for consults as many recommended, and I wasn’t feeling worried about sex coming up later.

Monday night roles around, it was my first long day of work of the new year. I crawled into bed a bit early as I was exhausted. About 10 minutes after laying in bed my wife immediately starts “initiating”.  This really took me by surprise as we had literally just discussed not doing this. I kept turning her down but she kept asking why and kept trying to touch me. I told her no I’m tired and we just discussed not doing this. That’s when she rolled over and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the night.

The next day after work we had our first argument ever. It wasn’t very productive, every time I tried to explain how I was feeling she kept saying “yeah but that’s a you problem not a me problem”. I don’t think she understood what I was saying or I wasn’t clear about how I was feeling. I’m hoping one of the therapist I reached out turn out to be a good fit. I’m hoping they can help me convey my emotions better.

All in all, this is still unresolved. Neither of us are happy right now. I’m hoping therapy helps.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-10T23:34:36.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/s/YvKTUNHZ4I""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/s/YvKTUNHZ4I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"I (29yro female) have been working at my current job for over three years now, not without issues. One of the big issues is scheduling, which brings me to my current dilemma.
My schedule manager has a habit of scheduling me on days I’ve previously told her I am not able to work. Usually I suck it up and just go into work because I hate the feeling of disappointing others. This included having to cancel therapy appointments and having to skip church every once and a while for a work meeting when I’ve had a no Sunday availability since I first got hired because I celebrate the sabbath.
Recently, however my uncle has opened my dream store, literally a store we used to talk about as creatives. As a way to help, I work on Wednesdays since he also has a family no workers besides his 2 oldest who have their own jobs now.
I told my scheduling manager that I wouldn’t be able to work on Wednesday’s at all at the end on November 2023. But recently has started scheduling me every other Wednesday. When I asked about it, I was met with hostility yet there are other employees who are given that day off and didn’t ask for it.
Today is the first Wednesday I’ve been scheduled for a while so I put my foot down, messaged my manager and told her I wasn’t coming in because I previously told them I would not be able to come in on Wednesdays and will be prioritizing my family. My manager hasn’t answered me back since and now I’m scared to go in tomorrow.
Am I in the wrong for sticking up for myself? Or should I have just buried my head in the sand once again and let them roll over me like usual? (Kind of wishing I did the last one)

Update:
I finally quit. I got written up for switching my shift (with another supervisor and I got permission from my Assistant Manager who then denied it [isn’t the first time she’s lied to save her self]) I didn’t give a 2 weeks notice, in fact I just gave them my resignation and that was that. The job not only took a toll on my mental health, but it started to trickle into my physical health. On top of that, they belittled my inability to not work on Wednesdays by saying I didn’t show up just because “I didn’t want to”, then stating after I reexplained my reasons that it was a convenient excuse…
I find it confusing because this was a second job for me, even if it’s my uncles store. Accommodations were also able to be made, the excuse they used is that they “couldn’t schedule people for so many day in a row” but the next schedule had them in for 6 days (Mon-Sat) where this one had them for 3 and 2 (Sun-Tues, Thurs-Fri).
Lastly the last couple months were filled with verbal abuse. I got yelled at for not being able to come in when I had progressively worsening Covid. Even the staff was hit with “it’s like babysitting 101 in here” (70% new people, btw), being fired for being sick or living with a mental health condition when they were super hard and great workers who often got customer complaints, or being put down for not finishing 1/5 tasks (2 or 3 mini ones sprinkled in) given for the day even though the other 4 were done perfectly, yet without recognition.
Worst part, this is just the last couple months, the full history of working here, the whole company is out of control. The fact that I stayed for 3 years boggles me as well as most of my friends and family.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-11T01:50:50.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (29yro female) have been working at my current job for over three years now, not without issues.

Even the staff was hit with “it’s like babysitting 101 in here” (70% new people, btw), being fired for being sick or living with a mental health condition when they were super hard and great workers who often got customer complaints, or being put down for not finishing 1/5 tasks (2 or 3 mini ones sprinkled in) given for the day even though the other 4 were done perfectly, yet without recognition.
Worst part, this is just the last couple months, the full history of working here, the whole company is out of control. The fact that I stayed for 3 years boggles me as well as most of my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

As anyone who does recreational drugs in pill form knows, due to them being illegal, you can't exactly be picky about the shape your pills come in - and with our bad luck, the 2C-B pills available to us at the moment are in the shape of the Nazi eagle - no one I do these drugs with is a Nazi, every one of us absolutely hates them and stands against them - we sometimes joke that Geert Wilders (newly-elected Dutch prime minister, right-wing and anti-inmigrant) is trying to convert people to Nazism through the pills, that's it

One detail I hadn't really noticed until tonight is that the swastika has the points facing counterclockwise, which is not the swastika used by the Nazis according to what I know

I posted a pill on my story for laughs, not thinking much of it, and my mother replied very upset, saying it was stupid and racist or something....now both of my sisters are judging the hell out of me too and being vile to me......it helps to remember that they love to judge others and hold things against people to make themselves feel better

"So I work at a pretty well known retail store and this has just made my day. So my store along with several others in my area have been short staffed lately and so in turn we only had our self checkouts open. Now normally we generally only have our self checkouts open with maybe like one or two manned check lanes open anyways but today we didn't have anyone that we could spare to even do the normal two lanes we have. Well a long line forms behind our self checkouts because for whatever reason everyone decided to go shopping and I'm the self checkout attendant so I'm going between all of the self checkouts assisting with what needs to be done when this rude lady storms up to me and demands that someone open up a lane because she doesn't work at our store so she doesn't feel like she should be at self checkout. I inform her politely that we unfortunately don't have anyone else who can work a lane which is why we have only our self checkout lanes open. At this she told me that I was here perfectly fine and I could open up a checklane to get her through and that this was self checkout so they didn't need someone over here. I told her that isn't how it works and I'm here to help if one of them goes down or eats someone's change or to remove security tags. I did inform her that she could go to the customer service desk on the other end of our store and they could assist in her checkout but other than that I couldn't help.

This lady kept insisting that either I open a lane or get someone else to open a lane as she didn't want to walk to the other end of the store. I ended up contacting my manager who after he came over he told me to just open up a lane and leave self checkout for a minute for this lady. Who of course has a cartful of things. After that though and seeing her walk off with a smirk on her face more people went to the lane before I could close it so I ended up having to juggle a checklane and self checkout by myself for 30 minutes. After that I took my break and spent it crying in the bathroom.

Now come the next day though I confronted the manager about how he treated the whole situation as he should have had my back as the last was verbally abusive towards me. He basically told me that there are battles that you have to pick and chose and with the lady he chose to not argue and ultimately he couldn't have done it as he was busy with other work, though he didn't specify. I told him that he specifically chose to overwork me instead of helping and that because of that I had a breakdown in the bathroom.

"My partner and I both get bank holidays off work which means at easter we get a 4 day weekend. March and April are the two busiest months for my job so I am looking forward to having a relaxing 4 days.

My girlfriend was looking at days out we could do and I mentioned to her that I'd rather stay a bit closer to home and that I don't mind having a day in town where we live but I want to spend at least half of the time off relaxing.

She said I was wasting it and I should make the most of it but I just told her that I'm going to be tried from work so I'm thankful of the time off to rest. She said that I should want to to do things with her but I pointed out we have 3 nights away in February, 4 nights abroad this month and plans for June so it's not like we don't have anything coming up. 

She disagreed and said I should want to make the most of the time off and that I should be happy spending days out with her. I just repeated that I am happy for a local day out but I am wanting to use the time to relax and that she could always go on her own or with a friend.

"I live with my girlfriend and a lot of the things in our kitchen (cutlery, pans, plates etc) I brought with me. One of the things I brought was an expensive knife set that was my fathers who has passed away. I have had them for years and they are still in great condition. 

A problem I have been having with my gf is that she doesn't seem to treat a lot of things with respect. For example when washing up she will clean the knife and then pretty much clam in down in the cutlery part of our drying rack with the blade facing down. This has caused the end of two of the blades to become bent and damaged. 

I sat down to talk with her about this and asked her to take more care with them. She said she is only washing up and hasn't damaged anything. I pointed out the damage but she said it could have came from anywhere. I just asked if she could put it blade side up or dry it when she washes it and put it away straight away. 

She refused both and said there was nothing wrong with how she was doing it. I just said if she's not going to do that then she shouldn't wash them and should just leave them for me to do. She refused that and said I'm treating her like a child. I just said she was starting to act like one by not taking responsibility for the fact she's damaged something that has sentimental value for me and won't take any action to make sure it doesn't happen again. 

She just repeated that she isn't going to change how she washes the dishes and I just said I'd rather she didn't use the knives at all then. She said I was being unreasonable and ridiculous but I don't see how I am.

"My (now ex) bf and I were at a store a couple months ago and were looking at a display of cute, decorative magnets they had.

I was pointing out which ones I liked and he said “These look like plastic. It’s hard to tell if they’re real or not, ya know?”. He said this in a bit of an angry tone, but to be fair he was already in a bad mood and didn’t want to go out that day.

I didn’t know what he meant by “real magnets” because they were all stuck on a metal board so clearly they were magnetic. I asked what he meant by that and he just repeated that he doesn’t know if they’re real.

I took this to be some type of sly insult because he had questioned my loyalty, honesty, and if I’m “real or fake” with him many, many times throughout the relationship.

I got upset with him in the store because he wouldn’t explain what he meant by the real magnet comment and acted like I was being crazy for reading into it. Which maybe I was? 
I was going to buy him a couple things from the store but because of the fight I didn’t.

Was I wrong here? Are “real” vs “fake” magnets a thing?



EDIT: 

For context, I’ve never assumed that anybody else was insulting me indirectly like this prior to dating him. I got the idea that this could be a way of insulting someone because he had previously accused me of doing that. 

For example, I once said a drink he ordered was big (bc the portion was huge) and he thought that I only said the drink was big to make him feel like his dick was small.

"*This is purely fictional.  I am not married (or even dating anybody at the moment), and I do not have kids.  I plan to become a parent someday, but not right now.*

&amp;#x200B;

My husband, who we'll call Frank, feels very strongly about not disappointing our kids regarding promises he makes to them.  This is because his parents frequently broke promises, moved goalposts after making a deal, reneged on promised rewards for the tiniest misbehavior.  He's overcompensating for his childhood.  I, on the other hand, was raised with parents who generally kept their word.  But I was also raised to understand that essential stuff came first, and if the choices were essential errand or bill vs. promised activity or treat, then the promise had to be broken.

On to what sparked this particular conflict.  Frank needed to do the grocery shopping this afternoon because I had to work late, and he had promised our 7 year old son, who we'll call Marvin, that he'd take him to the trampoline park this afternoon.  Frank realized he didn't have time to do both, so he picked the promised fun but not necessary thing over the essential grocery shopping.

When I got home, I saw that the groceries had not been bought.  I asked him about it, and when he explained, I just snapped.  ""Sometimes you have to disappoint your kids, okay!  They need to learn that sometimes, things don't work out!  Now I have to get groceries because you can't get your priorities straight!""  I had to buy the groceries because he didn't want to disappoint Marvin.  He argued back ""They can learn that things don't always work out without us breaking our promises!""  We argued back and forth for quite a while.

"My fiance (M29) and I (M21) had recently gone to a birthday dinner type of thing for my older brother, El (M24). For context, My brother and i grew up in a crappy council house, basically lived in poverty, we were both kicked out of high school at fifteen and sixteen. We had to sort ourselves out, and we did a bunch of stuff which no one can really be proud of.

El's mates were there too, we had grown up together and we were talking about the stuff we did as teenagers. At one point, we talked about all the ways we tried to get money, about living in each other's houses and having nowt to eat in the house, so we made toast with bread that was going green and got the most awful food poisoning. This wasn't a pity party though, we weren't going round sharing our woes, we were laughing about it. We had it horrible growing up but we did our best to make it seem a laugh. Plus, we did have fun, it wasn't all doom and gloom.

After we got in the car to leave, Damon (my fiance), seemed bothered by it all. He grew up pretty standard middle class. He asked if I was okay, and started talking all about childhood trauma etc etc. I told him that it was fine, he doesn't have to pity me for being poor. He then started to lecture me, about how there's nothing funny about poverty and that by making a joke of it, we were minimizing the struggles. Said that we were 'masking' trauma by laughing about it. Just kept going on about this.

I told him that he just won't ever understand what it was like, because he's middle class. He went to a grammar school, he works in finance now - we are just on complete different ends of the spectrum. He's been upset about it recently, ignoring me and saying that i dont seem to view him as an equal purely because he has money.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-09T18:25:31.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My fiance (M29) and I (M21) had recently gone to a birthday dinner type of thing for my older brother, El (M24).

At one point, we talked about all the ways we tried to get money, about living in each other&amp;#39;s houses and having nowt to eat in the house, so we made toast with bread that was going green and got the most awful food poisoning. This wasn&amp;#39;t a pity party though, we weren&amp;#39;t going round sharing our woes, we were laughing about it. We had it horrible growing up but we did our best to make it seem a laugh. Plus, we did have fun, it wasn&amp;#39;t all doom and gloom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we got in the car to leave, Damon (my fiance), seemed bothered by it all. He grew up pretty standard middle class. He asked if I was okay, and started talking all about childhood trauma etc etc. I told him that it was fine, he doesn&amp;#39;t have to pity me for being poor. He then started to lecture me, about how there&amp;#39;s nothing funny about poverty and that by making a joke of it, we were minimizing the struggles. Said that we were &amp;#39;masking&amp;#39; trauma by laughing about it. Just kept going on about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him that he just won&amp;#39;t ever understand what it was like, because he&amp;#39;s middle class. He went to a grammar school, he works in finance now - we are just on complete different ends of the spectrum. He&amp;#39;s been upset about it recently, ignoring me and saying that i dont seem to view him as an equal purely because he has money.&lt;/p&gt;

"I (32F) met my husband (33m) at work. It is a high stress, high stakes job and my workplace is very close. 

My future husband (Jason) and I started together and became good friends. It took us by surprise when, one emotional night, Jason and I slept together. I had been saving myself for marriage, so this was huge for me. 

A lot of drama that happened, but to summarize - Jason and I had a on/off relationship for a while, which culminated in him pulling a “speak now” and me leaving my fiance at the alter to run off and marry Jason instead. 

We were both deliriously happy, until I became pregnant. 

During a routine ultrasound it was discovered that our son had a fatal genetic disorder. If I managed to carry him to term, he would only live a few painful hours.

Though devestated, we eventually decided to induce at 24 weeks, name and baptise our baby, and allow him to pass away in our arms. We named him Sawyer. 

After Sawyers death we went through the most difficult patch of our lives, but I think it was worse for me. I carried Sawyer in my body, I was his mother - and on top of that it led to a crisis of faith. I was drowning, every minute of every day, so when a colleague brought up an opportunity to use our professional skills to help others overseas, I jumped on the chance. 

Jason did not want me to leave, but i did - for a while year. He was happy when I came home, but it was clear he was resentful. He made that more clear when after a couple of weeks I told him I wanted to go back. He told me to do what I needed, but that if I went we were done. 

I thought he was overreacting snd being unfair to make demands of me while I was trying to deal with my grief, and I decided not to bow to his ultimatum. True to his word, when I came back he repeatedly asked for a divorce. 

I did not accept this. I was back and ready to fight for our marriage, but Jason believed I had acted selfishly and without any thought for his suffering. I tried to change his mind, we were even sleeping together for a while, but ultimately he could not be swayed. 

 A week ago, Jason and I met to sign divorce papers. Before I signed, I asked him one last time if it was what he really wanted. He said yes, and so we went through with it. 

Just that morning I had taken a pregnancy test, and it was positive. In the days since I have confirmed it, but I haven't told him. I did tell one of my coworkers and another coworker figured it out himself and confronted me.

Both of them say i need to tell Jason, and that im wrong for not doing so first. I don't think I did anything wrong - he didn't want to be with me, and I wasn't going to use my child to force him to stick around. I think it's my right to tell him whenever I want, he divorced me - he has no say in the decisions I make about this child until it is born. 

AITA for not telling him as soon as I found out, or are my friends just conflicted by their personal relationship with Jason?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-11T16:21:10.000Z","post","Fictional","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (32F) met my husband (33m) at work.

" Hello everyone throwaway account, the past few months my brother (24M) has been working hard in order to become a police officer. He graduates this week, while I (21M) am proud of what he has accomplished. He announced something that felt like a pretty big betrayal of not only me, but the rest of the family. He said that he invited my grandmother (mothers side of the family) who caused us so much trauma to the point where we shake / get anxiety when she's ever mentioned or brought up in a conversation. We all said to him how we're not going if my mother shows up since she abused the entire family and gave me PTSD (diagnosed by 2 different psychologists). They've both stalked us, and harassed us. Not only that they've attacked me on social media and blamed me for leaving that side of the family even though I was being abused by my mother and her mother. My brother has never believed that I have PTSD and thinks that I'm using it for attention so not only does that make that worse, he starts calling us immature if we leave his graduation if my mother shows up and says how they're going to be dead soon. I said to him ""Okay, and? What does that have to do with us?"" I'm never going to their funerals for the amount of pain and trauma they caused me and my family. They're both abusers, they would absolutely disown me if I ever come out to them. So not only that, my mother and my grandmother called the cops on my dads mother for thinking she locked her out of the house on ""purpose"" when actually she was just doing yard work, who also by the way had cancer and passed away and they knew that she had cancer. I straight up told him that I'm not going to his graduation since my grandmother is showing up and he claims that our mother wont show up but I highly doubt that.

"I(29f) and P(30m) have been having issues with my mentally disabled neighbour(40?m) for 2 months, i’ll call him ND. ND and his mother moved in next door and it started with ND putting my bin out then one day I heard a noise and looked out the window to see him staring at me, he went back to his garden, moved some stuff then leant over the fence, rang my doorbell and stared at the camera. When I go to my bins he’s stood in his window (about 3ft away) and staring. Days when I take my kids to nursery I leave through the back door, its a french door and the only way to get the pram out. I had noticed ND stood at his back window staring and we walked around to the front and he’d be at that window staring.

ND started to approach P any time he was outside and P is a friendly guy and sympathies. ND has became obsessed with my gate needing to be closed. Anytime the gate would be open ND would walk onto my property, past my driveway and to the gate to close it. P was clearing out the shed and ND approached him and told him several times to close the gate, P explained to him repeatedly that he was busy and needed the gate open but ND kept insisting it was closed.

A week ago P caught ND looking in my back door which leads into my kid’s playroom, luckily they weren’t here at the time because it would of scared them! It scared me because im here alone with my kids and its creepy to know you’re being watched and someone is looking into where my kids play! P spoke to ND and told him he is not allowed in my garden and he needed to leave and ND said we needed to lock the gate.

Yesterday was the final straw. P was jet washing his car and the garden, in 3 hours ND came out 9 times to complain and entered my back garden. P was getting impatient and told him to get out of the garden, ND held his hand out and said “come here”  P said “no thanks, you need to get out the garden” ND sulked and left.

Later I locked the door and saw ND closing my gate and I firmly told him he needs leave, he started apologising and I said “you need to get out of my garden right now” He started walking towards me saying “I need to have a word with you” I started shouting until he backed up to my gate then started apologising. I told him where my garden starts and said “you are not allowed in my garden, do not come into my garden again and leave us alone!” As he left he said “see you soon” which was terrifying. I was shaking and my heart was racing! I have never felt so scared and I am concerned about what he will do next. 

I keep my blinds closed and im constantly looking on my doorbell app anytime there’s a noise outside, I don’t feel safe to leave my house, I am worried about my kids being scared, Im on edge about my doors always being locked, I have been losing sleep and having nightmares. I reported everything to the police online last night because his behaviour is getting more threatening but im being told im overreacting!

"Alright so I, 22F, have always been close to my immediate family and have family reunion every couple years or so. It's a thing that I used to enjoy but now I'm kinda indifferent about it for some reason or another. It's typically the fact that I'm always being pestered about when I'm going to find someone to at least be dating. Lately it's been a lot more because my Nana wants to see me with someone nice and her health has been declining. Well a little bit before we had our family reunion I had decided that I wasnt going to be pestered by the questions so I asked my best friend if he wanted to come to the reunion and act as by BF. He said he'd do that as I'm his friend and that he never actually has been to a family reunion.

Well everything was going fine the day of the reunion and I  didn't get asked a single time about when was I going to find the right one for me and we even got complimented as a cute couple and it made my Nana happy at least. Come the end of the night though I guess something must have tipped them off but my parents pulled me to the side and started getting mad at me that I would fake having a BF at an important family gathering.

"I'm a fan of 80s music and Billy Joel is one of my most favorite artists that I like listening to. I have most of his songs on an playlist on apple music. I've seen him twice.

" 

today was my (F18) boyfriend's (M18) big day, to see if he got an oxford unversity offer. i knew this ages ago, and was planning on being extra nice to him.

today he got rejected, and asked if he cld walk me home at 12.40PM. i said yes, naturally, because, why not? hes my boyfriend.

he asks to go get food, and i say if we are quick, because i had just spoken to my mom said she had just cooked food for me, as i was planning to be home for 1pm, and i said i would be home in 20 minutes, but realistically pushing that to 30 or even 40 would not be the worst.

we go to get him food, and we chat and he eats, i text my mom at 1:20PM that i might be an extra 20 mins because i was talking to my bf who wasn't feeling too good about his oxford rejection, which she is ok with.

we leave at 1:40PM and just miss the bus, and my bf says he wants to walk so 'its fine'. natually im already getting stressed, my mom is strict and i have already kept her waiting long enough, and another bus stops, but my bf doesnt make any indication of wanting to get on, so we dont. instead we walk home, all the way, and we each excuse ourselves of fault here.

at the beginning of the walk, i made it clear i wanted to take the bus back, and even mentioned this on the way to the restaurant we went to, and my stress and personal anguish got the better of me. i blamed him for making me so late, and told him it was his fault, and if we had taken the bus like i had said i wanted to, i think it would have maybe been ok. i blame him for this and i feel like i wasnt very nice to him. we see and walk by another bus, and neither he or i say anything about getting on, all he says is '\[bus name\] is taunting you lol' and laughs.

later on in the walk i got irritated, but realised that i was taking out my anger on him, so i told him i want to walk in silence so i don't yell, as i worry about my mom, but not before guilting him about how mad my mom is going to be.

before he leaves, i hug and kiss him and tell him i love him, and apologise for making this all about me, and he says its fine because im going to get in trouble anyways, so i should just hurry up and get home.

he says i should have said i wanted to get on the bus, and i say its his fault for not indicating he was ok to. i end up getting home at 2.40PM, and i blamed him on this day that i know was meant to be about him. now he is angry with me, saying i always apologise and he feels like it wasn't his day but about me, which i was apologising for in the first place, and said that i never seem to change, AITB?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-09T19:13:33.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;today was my (F18) boyfriend&amp;#39;s (M18) big day, to see if he got an oxford unversity offer. i knew this ages ago, and was planning on being extra nice to him.&lt;/p&gt;

"My boyfriend's daughter (8f)  had the audacity to tell her school and friends thay i'm her personal servant and i'm a unpaid nanny who lives with her dad, but I am so livid that my boyfriend's daughter would try to brush me off as some nanny or hired servant and my boyfriend or his daughters mum can't pick her up due to my boyfriend being ill and his kids mums car has broken down. I understand i'm not her parent, but I do want her to be civil atleast as her father's girlfriend since they are also in my care during his custody time and I help look after his children. It feels like even a personal servant, maid or a unpaid nanny get more respect and taken more seriously.

I don't usually pick her up, but she was feeling sick and no one else was able to pick her up [my boyfriend's kids mum went nc with her parents so they can't pick her up, and there's a virus going around where I live so that's why alot of people are poorly and unable to pick her up], his parents are in United States. My boyfriend does do something about her behaviour, tells her off and she's even in therapy and we changed therapists to, but I still can't believe she would disrespect me like that regardless. I decided I didn't want to put up with her disrespect and I want to not pick her up anymore if she will continue to disrespect me, but I feel bad about leaving a sick child at school or burderning her maternal grandparents and my boyfriend. WIBTBF if I stop picking my boyfriends daughter up?

edit to add because of post character limit, I also want to add that I am on the emergency contact list. Apparently she got this idea from a post on social media where a girl referred to her stepparent as her personal servant because one of her cousins uses reddit (most of her cousins are older) and she overlooked at the post and thought it would be funny to do it to me aswell.

"So I've been talking to this woman that I met on a site for about a couple of months. We seem to get along pretty good until I brought up a subject of what I want her to wear at a wedding reception. She was talking about what we would do if we were to get married and said that she wants to have a wedding in two years from now if we continue to get along pretty good. She brought up outfit ideas and told me that she wanted to wear a typical white wedding dress for the wedding which I'm ok with but at the reception I want her to wear something different. I told her that I wanted her to wear a traditional chinese qipao dress for the reception as I find those dresses very sexy and hot and I told her that I would love to see her in one. I have a couple of them myself that I do for crossplay and so I know how hot they look on anyone cause they look hot even on me. I told her that I would be willing to pay big butts like maybe hundreds of US dollars to get her a beautiful custom made one like the ones that I have seen in chinese dramas. She got offended and told me ""Why would I want to wear a chinese dress if I'm a vietnamese woman living in vietnam ? I want to wear an ao dai. I don't like those dresses cause shanghai prostitutes used to wear them."". I argued and told her that it is not true cause these actresses wear them all the time, even miss chinatown USA contestants wear them. I told her that even some vietnamese brides have worn one for their weddings. I begged and pleaded with her but she got mad and told me that she needed time alone. She hasn't gotten back to me. I just don't understand what was so wrong about it. I asked my friends for their input and they told me that I was wrong to ask her that and that I'm a huge asshole saying that the bride gets to choose what they want to wear.

"So I (23m) have a sister (18f). She has some animosity towards one of her teachers, because the teacher leads an extracurricular music group, and has not chosen my sister in all 4 years of her high school. My sister is very passionate about music, and feels the teachers judgment was unwarranted. I'm not really musically inclined, so I'm not the best person to ask if these assessments were valid.

We are both very passionate about horses. I often maintain my parents' stables and she often volunteers at local horse stables.

My (16m) brother (19m) was in his room with his boyfriend which is right next to mine. They where drinking  (just to excuse him a bit because he normally doesn’t act like this, also this was New Year’s Day to excuse the afternoon drinking) 

I think they where watching movies and shit by the sound of it or had them on in the background or whatever, they started singing along to Can you feel the love tonight, which I think you understand the cringe 😬 🤮 

So I record it and intend to send it to him at the time just for a laugh but forget about it until I find it in my camera roll today and send it to him, in the same message I call him gay for knowing the full song (we joke like the regularly don’t think I’m homophobic) 

He gets REALLY mad at me for recording him and starts having a real go at me for it and being angrier than he really had any right to be.

When I was 15 in sophomore year, I had a friend [15M] Johnathan who was dating a senior [18F]. They “dated” in our sophomore year. I out dated in quotes because for for some odd reason they refused to associate with each other in school. But they were in a relationship according to my friend. 

Johnathan used to flirt with me at the lunch table saying I was cute and “fine”. Either I eat in silence or said that I would tell his girlfriend (empty threats).he also flirted with me on snap, but I did causally remind him of his girlfriend but casually bringing her up in conversation, and then he would stop.  However, he was very touchy with me. Where I went wrong is I gave him hugs back. So we really did hug a lot when we saw each other as I was also a touchy person who hugged everyone, but I don’t think I should’ve hugged a taken man that much and should’ve told him to stop. I did think he was cute and I explicitly remember er me telling my Online friends how I thought he was cute but did not want to come between anything. however and almost felt myself starting to develop a crush until this happened:

My friend then told me he was trying to line me up as a second choice by his own confession and I was so mad and hurt.  So ig here is when I realized what he was doing and my friend and I called him out and “cut him off”, but then our friend group forgave him for some reason. I blocked him a few months later. Which is also around the time he broke up with his gf where he admitted he never really liked her and just saw her as a friend. But in our senior year he made a new account and started messaging me asking if he could take me out and I went. Later on while he was talking about wanting to date me in our “talking phase” I reminded him about how he was trying to cheat on his gf. Then I slowly stopped speaking on him. 

I being all this up because his ex gf is messaging me now saying I was a homewrecker and the cause of their relationship not working. I’m confused because when they broke up, quarantine happened and I hadn’t even talked to the man in months. She is demanding an apology. Now I don’t know if I should respond? I have one friend saying that I should to clear the air, but another friend saying not to because she believes the gf essentially groomed him because she was 18 and he was 15. In so conflicted.

N didn’t get any christmas presents this year so I told my grandma, and she got him a bunch of colored pencils (i suggested it), and my mom ordered him his favorite flavor of sour patch kids. I gave those to him, plus bought him a $30 DLC for a game. He’s very thankful for all of that, yeah…. But then my other friend, A, also found out he didn’t get anything. So what do they buy him? 

&amp;#x200B;

A DnD mimic lego set.

THREE OF HIS FAVORITE THINGS COMBINED.

He looked so pumped when he opened the gift on camera. He immediately started building it and kept thanking A. Meanwhile I just sat there… I feel.. Jealous? Mad? I dont know. But it absolutely sucks and I feel awful for feeling like this. It’s like I’m mad A got N something he loved. Im glad he likes it, but something is telling me that I should be the only one getting him cool stuff. I should be the only friend who makes him happy. I deserve all the positive attention.

" My stepbrother did this...


(Backstory:I used to live in Iowa with my mom before I moved out and moved to Georgia with my dad.-story for another day.


When I was female(11), I first started my ""lady stuff."" My stepbrother stole the used pads from the bathroom trash and had them in his pillow. They blamed it all on his autism. I had rolled them in multiple sheets of toilet paper like I was supposed to. I had just gotten out of the shower when my dad called me freaking out and screaming at me about how disgusting I was and how much of a perv I was. I did not understand. He then called back a few minutes later, crying telling me everything. He had told me about my stepbrother stealing my pads from the bathroom trashcan and hiding them in his pillow case. I don't get along with my stepbrother for that exact reason. I told my now ex about what happened cause he asked why I didn't like him. He told my stepbrothers girlfriend because I left my ex. My stepbrothers girlfriend left him. Today, my stepmother gets a call from him saying his girl broke up with him. My dad and stepmother come out screaming at me. They threatened to spread private pictures of me all over the school and ruin my life like I ruined his. They told me I was going to be forced to leave the guy I'm currently with. However, this is my first healthy relationship. He cares about me when shit is going down and doesn't judge. This is the first really healthy relationship I've ever been in. Things around my school do NOT spread fast. They're talked about for a couple of days, then completely forgotten. At the beginning of my junior year of high school, I went to a football game and had passed out and busted my chin wide open. People talked about it for a day, and then everybody forgot. My dad and stepmother said I was an attention seeker and a whore. Ever since I moved in with my dad, my stepmother has been very defensive and awful towards me. She pretends I'm not there when her blood children are there, and when they aren't, I'm all of a sudden her best friend in the whole world. I told my man about how my dad was going to tell my mom to go to my mans work and tell him I'm breaking up with him. I told my boyfriend about the situation and how everything was going to go down. He understood we are a long-distance couple, he's 19, and I'm 17. They told me that im too focused on my boyfriends.

"For some context, I (16f) have a bit of a traumatic experience with rain. When I was 12, I got into a spat with my parents and they kicked me out into 10 °C in nothing but flip-flops, a sleeveless shirt and shorts. It was also heavily raining, I was out for about half an hour. Since then, I don't like rain, not even when I'm inside. I don't usually go around telling people that, I just say I don't like rain.

This happened about 4 hours ago. Two of my friends convinced me to go with them to the city centre, and I agreed to go with them for maybe an hour at most so my parents wouldn't notice my absence. I was with a bike (walking beside it), and when it started to rain more heavily, I put my coat over my basket with my bag so it doesn't get wet. I have some medical stuff in my bag that can't get wet, as well as I just don't want all my notebooks wet and ruined.

While walking, they made passive jokes about my distaste for rain (they both love rain), specifically my request that we find a café where there's a roof to put my bike under, as I wasn't interested in having to dry the seat and basket before I went home. I suggested cafés close by that we can go to. We literally only went to one of them, they didn't like it, and then the two decided to go to a mall café a bit further away.

Instead of waiting for a green light, they went under the road (idk how to call those tunnels), completely oblivious to the fact I couldn't go down the stairs and had to go all around to find the bike path down. We get to the café, when suddenly, they remember there's another café in the underground part of the mall. Again forgetting I have a bike, they just went downstairs, and when I, very frustrated at this point since I was soaking wet, shivering and could barely see through my glasses, said that no, we're not changing our minds now again, they just told me a bike path downstairs is around the corner and left. I then decided enough was enough, I hadn't enjoyed a second of this, I was going home. 

I started crying, completely overwhelmed, and then the two came back up to ask me why I hadn't gone down yet. I told them I'm done, we've been walking around in the rain for 30 minutes because they couldn't choose a café, I'm going home. They just looked at me, then smiled, said their goodbyes, like everything was chill, then walked back downstairs. I cried the whole way home (while biking in the rain, still cold and wet), and am now sitting at home writing this.

The thing about this and why I think I was in the wrong, I never out rightly told them I was uncomfortable. I did tell them I didn't enjoy rain but that's it. I've also been told that I always think I'm the only one in the right, and if I think that, I'm probably in the wrong.

I also have no idea how to confront them about it on Monday since they apparently think everything was fine. I don't want to break our friendship over this since this was the first time, but I feel like they owe my an apology.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-05T18:20:08.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some context, I (16f) have a bit of a traumatic experience with rain.

"The main story happened in Aug.  

I, 18 female, came of age this summer and began dating a friend of a friend I met at a party, let's call him Dave (19m). I also have been very close friends with a girl since I was 11, let's call her Holly(16f). Holly was weirdly jealous of this new romance and when I asked her if she was interested in him and offered to stop seeing him if she was uncomfortable with it, she denied having any feelings for him and just said he was cool.

Not long after this, according to Holly, Dave tried to kiss her while we were out celebrating my birthday. He denied it and I assumed she was making it up for attention as she had been displaying this problematic behaviour for a while. I then went to my home country to see my family and another similar incident was made aware to me by her. Everyone else at the bar debunked her.  Our mutual friend, Connor (19m) was having a party to celebrate Holly's 17th birthday while I was away. Connor would deny it to this day but he was completely in love with Holly and introduced me to his best friend Dave.

I had asked Dave if he would be ok with not to go to the party as I was uncomfortable with her behaviour at the time. He said it would be fine and he was going. I had a strange feeling but I put it up to paranoia. When I came back we spent a few days together and slept together for the 1st time. A few hours after I took him home I left my phone unattended. When I opened my phone I had 20 missed calls from Connor and a few texts, my stomach fell out of me. Holly had confessed to Connor that her and Dave hooked up in Connor's bed the night of the party.

Honestly it was very messy and being on antidepressants, I was unable to cry or really get angry and process it but Connor was devastated and I went round to his house to see if he was okay. 

I ended up texting her the next day when I had calmed down and here is the text I sent 

""It's been a few hours and I've calmed down now but let me make something very clear. Dave is not the only f@#king pr!ck in this because you are the dirtiest two faced wh0r£ I have ever met. You are a rotten c@#t to the core and if I ever see you again I will..."" I have to censor this due to the guidelines sorry. Basically threatened to tell her mum what she has become (like her cheater father).

I do want to make something very clear I was just as hard on Dave as Holly but honestly her betrayal was 100× worse to me due to the long friendship vs 2 months or so of dating.

All this was is August but a few days ago I cut off a friend called Oliver (17NB) due to their two faced comments and entitlement. One thing he said to a very close friend of mine was that I was ""overreacting to the whole situation and that Holly was just a teen girl who doesn't know any better"". Some information would be that Oliver has a past of cheating on partners. 

So AITB for cutting off Dave, Holly and now Oliver?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-06T00:39:48.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main story happened in Aug.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, 18 female, came of age this summer and began dating a friend of a friend I met at a party, let&amp;#39;s call him Dave (19m). I also have been very close friends with a girl since I was 11, let&amp;#39;s call her Holly(16f). Holly was weirdly jealous of this new romance and when I asked her if she was interested in him and offered to stop seeing him if she was uncomfortable with it, she denied having any feelings for him and just said he was cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after this, according to Holly, Dave tried to kiss her while we were out celebrating my birthday. He denied it and I assumed she was making it up for attention as she had been displaying this problematic behaviour for a while. I then went to my home country to see my family and another similar incident was made aware to me by her. Everyone else at the bar debunked her.  Our mutual friend, Connor (19m) was having a party to celebrate Holly&amp;#39;s 17th birthday while I was away. Connor would deny it to this day but he was completely in love with Holly and introduced me to his best friend Dave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had asked Dave if he would be ok with not to go to the party as I was uncomfortable with her behaviour at the time. He said it would be fine and he was going.

&lt;p&gt;I ended up texting her the next day when I had calmed down and here is the text I sent &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been a few hours and I&amp;#39;ve calmed down now but let me make something very clear.

"AITA For watching porn when my girlfriend doesn’t approve.

So my gf(18F) and I(19M) have gotten into a little fight recently and I’m just wondering if I’m being a dick about it. We were laying in bed Wednesday night just watching a movie and we were talking and the conversation steered to her asking me if I watch porn. I said I do which prompted her to say that she doesn’t really like porn bc she thinks it’s gross I said I’m sorry she feels that way and the we got distracted and the conversation ended there. However, yesterday night we were texting and the conversation was brought up again when she said that she doesn’t really like porn bc she thinks it’s gross and she doesn’t like me looking at naked women. I said that I don’t really watch porn exclusively to see naked women, I usually like to watch couples. It’s more of the whole act that turns me on rather than seeing naked women. She said she still thinks it’s gross and she doesn’t feel comfortable with me watching it. I said I’m sorry she feels that way and I asked if she had any alternatives for me in mind other than porn. She doesn’t really feel comfortable with sending nudes or anything like that over the internet or over text, which I  completely fine with, it’s not for everyone. However, she also doesn’t have the same sex drive as me as mine is quite high and hers is not. She doesn’t always want to have sex and I am completely fine with that, I don’t want to have sex w someone who isn’t really into it anyway. We also are in sort of a mid-distance type situation in which I only get to see her every weekend as I am in college. She asked why I can’t just use my mind and I told her that my mind wanders and starts to worry abt other things and porn just makes it easier. We both ended the conversation quite upset as we didn’t come to an understanding. She still thinks it’s gross and cheating for me to watch porn but I purely see it as a tool to use when I want to finish quickly. I don’t want her to be hurt but at the same time Ik I wont really be able to stop since I cannot empathize with the problem here.

"I haven't seem my best friend in around 5 months as we live in different towns. We had made plans to go out for drinks and since there are a lot of good bars in our town, we said we'd make a night of it and go on a little bar crawl and probably go to a club at the end of the night. 

I was talking to my girlfriend and mentioned the bars we were thinking about going to and she said it sounds fun. She asked if she could come along and I told her she can come next time but this time I just want to catch up with my friend, just the two of us. 

She asked why and I just said I don't expect to go out with her and her friends whenever they meet up so there shouldn't be an issue with me meeting a friend. She said it seems like I'm hiding something but I just said that me wanting to see a friend on my own is not me hiding something. 

I pointed out it's not healthy to expect to go on every social activity with your partner and that it's healthy to see friends on your own but she just repeated it seems suspicious and that she doesn't see an issue with her coming along. 

I told her I've explained the issue, she's just choosing to ignore it but she just said I was causing an argument over nothing.

"My girlfriend (20) and I (19) have fought recently because I rarely communicate when I want to have sex and it upsets her. So I started asking flat-out if we could have sex at that moment because she said that's a normal thing to do. I agree with her as I understand that she can't give clear consent without me directly asking her. I have been doing this for a while and it's been fine until yesterday.

We had just woken up and it was pretty late in the day, we tend to sleep in until about noonish. I was in the mood so I asked if she wanted to have sex. She checked the time and told me that we wouldn't have time as she needed to go home soon and get ready for work. We eventually did some sexual activities until she had to go. However, before she left she told me she would be back tonight and we could have sex then.

That night before she arrived she texted me saying her body hurts from work, so I thought having sex wasn't likely. She gets to my house at 12:20 AM and she continues saying her feet hurt and she's tired, yet she still seems a little enthusiastic. At this time I was playing on my PC and she was watching TikTok. We were talking about each other's day and other stuff, she even watched me play and cheered me on for some time. Yet while we were talking, she never once said anything about us having sex. To be honest, I didn't feel like having sex that night as I wasn't feeling the best, but that would not have stopped me from doing it if she had asked me. After about an hour, I turned off my PC and noticed she was in bed asleep on her phone. I then got in bed and fell asleep.

The next morning she wakes me up around noon and we kiss and enjoy laying in bed together for a while. Eventually, we exchanged ""I love you"" and some more kisses and she left to get ready for work. A few minutes later she texted me ""I thought we were going to have sex last night."" with a period so I knew she was mad. I told her she never said anything and fell asleep. This eventually turned into an argument where I was telling her I didn't know she still wanted to have sex because she never said anything while she was saying she was waiting for me and hoping I'd get off my PC. At some point, I did get pretty angry as she says I rarely communicate with her and I shouldn't get upset when she doesn't want to have sex (both things I 100% agree with and no longer do). I called her a hypocrite for doing the things she's gotten so mad at me for doing in multiple messages, each getting an ""Ok"" as a response from her.

After that, she told me not to message her and she didn't want to talk. She has told me I needed to communicate with her at the moment when I wanted to have sex, but she didn't do that to me last night. Should I have just assumed that because she said she wanted to that morning she would want to hours later after work? I don't feel like what I did was wrong, but I still feel guilty for it.

"So this happened almost exactly a month ago and my memory is a bit blurry, but I can’t seem to get it out of my head. For context, I and all my friends are in an Aussie high school and it is recess.

My friends and I are sitting at a table outside at recess and I can’t remember exactly how many people were there but there are two people who are the most important, for privacy reasons I will call them Shane and Earrings. All of us were reading a book I had recently gotten and making jokes and reading parts of the book, after the conversation about it died down and swapped I put my headphones on and continued reading. After a while I heard Shane say to Earrings “why are you ugly” all of us at the table were shocked and I started going off at him asking him why he would say that, 

Me “Why the fuck would you say that? That’s not ok!”

Shane ”mind your fucking business”

Me “no what the fuck” 

It kept going on when Earrings spoke up and was almost crying, Earrings told us that they had been bullied for how they looked. The bell rung and Shane stood up, he flipped me off and said something I can’t remember, I called him a cunt and punched him in the arm, he immediately spins around and punches me in the back of the head (right side) making me pass out hit my head on the table then fell to the ground. 

The next part is only what I have been told as I don’t remember much, but I do remember hearing a blood curdling scream from Earrings and them shouting my name. Apparently I was out for 30 seconds to 2 minutes. An older student and a few teacher came up to me and Earrings ran to the office to get help. I have autism so the shock of everything sent me into a nonverbal episode and could barely move or stand. I communicated by squeezing the older student’s hand. When I got to the office (I was wheeled there in a wheelchair) I passed out and additional 3-4 times. My right shoulder and neck was extremely sore. I ended up going to hospital and had to get X-rays on my spine and neck. For those wondering, I was all fine, probably got a minor concussion but no broken bones. 

I am worried that my reaction and response to the conflict with Shane and Earrings was inappropriate and I might have been a buttface.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-04T08:04:04.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this happened almost exactly a month ago and my memory is a bit blurry, but I can’t seem to get it out of my head.

It's a mom that doesn't work full time and a 21 y/o daughter that doesn't work or go to school. The daughter claims she has mental heath issues and can't take good care of the animals and that her mom has an alcohol problem so they're ""doing their best"".

They also had a broken fence so their dogs would be in our yard digging, pooping, and destroying stuff almost every day.

My hubby has fixed the fence numerous times over the past 3 years. There were 4 broken pickets. I confronted the daughter about the dogs tearing up our yard and she said ""I'm doing my best, I have mental health issues and my mom let's all the animals out  when she's drunk because she doesn't know better. We can't afford a $10k fence."" I explained that replacing the 4 pickets would be less than $40 and if she purchased my husband would fix it.

Hub has helped these 2 out a lot with no thanks or anything.  

We have no fence and there's direct access to a parking lot and highway from our house. I don't want the dogs to get hit so the last time they were at our house I called animal control. They had the fence fixed the next day. Turns out we aren't the only ones who called. They've already been to court and got an almost $800 fine for the same thing.

"Early on in the relationship I used to call my bf cute on occasion. I never meant anything bad by this, as to me calling someone cute means you both find them attractive and like cuddly at the same time.

However after a while he basically told me that he doesn’t like it because cute feels emasculating. I explained to him that I never meant it like that, but that I wouldn’t use that word anymore because I don’t want to upset him.

Probably about a month after this conversation, we were out on a date at a museum. After the museum we decided to take some pictures of one another outside with a new Polaroid camera I got.

I took a picture of him and we were both admiring it. I mindlessly said “Cute!” when I first saw it and told him that it looked good. I genuinely didn’t say it with bad intent, I just thought it was cute that I now had this lovely Polaroid of him.

He instantly said “What did you just say??”. I realized what I said and apologized right away, letting him know I didn’t mean to upset him.

He was pissed for the rest of date and kept saying that I purposely said it to make him upset. I do understand that I shouldn’t have said it, but I started to get pissed too because of how he was assuming I wanted to hurt him and was being cold to me after I thought we had a nice time in the museum. He started to accuse me of not even really liking him and said he could sense I was being off/weird in the museum. I thought I was being normal though.

"I'm not trying to excuse what I did.  More so trying to understand the severity of it.  Here's the context:

Last year I (m22) met someone (m22) really cool in an online game.  I texted them after and asked if they'd want to play more matches together, so we kept squading up and talking.  For a while we were becoming friends and then eventually we confessed we both had feelings for each other.  We felt so good and comfortable around the other that we asked to be the other's babe.  For the next couple months we talked to each other like we were in a relationship.

I think the difficult part for me was not knowing how serious it was.  There were times with him I felt he was my love, and we shared something so special.  And then I'd think ""we don't know each other's first name.  We have never video or phone chatted.  I don't know his voice I barely know how he looks."".  We live in entirely different countries and we would go long periods of time without talking.  I think at one point we went almost a week without talking.  I fully understand people are busy and our lives are very disconnected in real life, it made me sad because I didn't know if we'd work.  I didn't even know what to make of our relationship.  Neither of us told anyone.

The flipside is I did tell him we were boyfriend's.  I committed to that and when we were together we certainly felt and acted the part.  After a couple months he broke it off.  He told me we barely feel apart of each other's life to be considered lovers, and he wants to love someone in person.  It made me super sad because he was the first person I felt such strong feelings for.

Now almost a year later, we've been friends since and we confessed that we both still have feelings for each other.  We want to do it differently this time.  We shared our names, voices, faces more.  We're not making anything official until we can find a good solution to the physical distance, but we're vibing super well together.

The problem is, during our first go around I would sometimes text other guys on apps.  I feel so dumb doing it now seeing how our bond grew.  I think at the time I didn't think of our relationship as real so I'd hit up other guys just to talk and flirt.  I didn't have him in mind at all when I was doing it, sort of something I was used to.  But now with us planning on getting back together, I don't think I can live with this secret.  I'm not sure if he'd be hurt or not, when we broke up he said he had trouble seeing us as a thing too but I don't think he was talking to other guys either.  He was more mature for telling me and being honest.  I feel horrible for doing this when we were together.  I'm not sure how to move on from this.  I feel like I've already ruined my chance with him for doing this :(","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-04T02:05:11.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to excuse what I did.

We’re both 20.

She told me that in sophomore year of her hs (so 15?) there was a guy who took interest in her while in a relationship. She claims she never flirted with him or reciprocated his flirting (she said she used to say she was ""fine"" and cute and stuff) but she used to hug him all the time because she thought he was cute. He also texted her on “Snapchat” and he would flirt with her, but sometimes randomly she would ask him “how’s your gf”. Like would visit him and her friend in his hr and hug him and talk to him. Then she called him out for saying she was a second choice and he stopped the flirting or whatever.

Two years later in her senior year, after he was already broken up with his other gf he asks her on a date and she goes. She also claims she was uncomfortable during it and like a few weeks later called him out for trying to cheat on his gf back in her sophomore year and then cut him off because she ""came to her senses"" after allowing him back into her life. 

She has OCD and has been thinking about this for awhile now and tells me she feels like a terrible irredeemable person. I know she feels bad, but I feel like this is a red flag almost. Like she doesn’t respect boundaries almost and might cheat on the future if she condoned it…She’s upset and sad that I’m upset with her for her own actions

"Eversince we were teenagers my sister (30) and I (27F) have been very close. We had the kind of relationship where we could say anything to each other. There was only one secret I ever kept from my sister and that was that I am bisexual. 

4 years ago I was finally ready to come out to her. When I came out to her she said she was ""okay"" with it. After that I felt she was holding back in our relationship. I gave her several opportunities to talk out any hang ups she was having about it but she always maintained that she was fine. When I would try to talk about a girl I was dating she would never really engage in the conversation. She would just say things like ""Oh, that's cool"" or ""interesting"" and not provide anyway to continue the conversation. 

At the time I always just brushed if off because she was busy and going through a lot and I didn't want to make it all about me. 

Last year she had her first child and a I flew out to meet my niece. One day while the baby was napping we got to talking and my worst fears were confirmed. 

She told me that she believed that gay people shouldn't get married and that they should choose to be single because homosexuality is a sin.

I explained to her that while I understood belief I personally have found it really damaging and painful. She said the belief isn't homophobic it just means that gay people need to live differently. I told her that I have heard it all before and that I personally think it's homophobic because the fundamental belief behind it is that there is something wrong with gay people. 

I explained to her that being taught these beliefs when we were kids had lead to the development of my depression and anxiety disorders and had taught me to hate myself from a young age and had lead to years of therapy. 

At that point we reached an impass. I flew back home and cried the entire three hour flight back. Since then I never call her or have the long open conversations we used to have and she hasn't called either. We have had little contact beyond texting about family things. 

A year later I visited my sister again. She pulled me aside and said she was upset that we weren't as close as we used to be. I told her we weren't as close as we used to be because of her personal beliefs about my sexuality. I said it is impossible to have the same relationship as we had before because she neither accepts nor supports me that means that I cannot be as open with her. 

She said I was being intolerant of her religious beliefs and I explained that I tolerated and even accepted her beliefs but that she can't hold those beliefs and expect that we will be as close as we were before. 

 My sister brought other family members into it and they all say that I am being too sensitive and that I shouldn't damage our relationship over a ""little difference in opinion"". This made me wonder if I am the asshole for putting distance in our relationship.

Edit: Just to clarify she and the rest of my family don't oppose the legal right of lgbt people to marry. They think they should choose a life of abstinence.

He looked sad and tried to hug me, but I walked off and went to go sit in my car. I stayed in there for 30 minutes. I then pulled myself together and went back inside to go watch TV. My husband was sitting on the couch. After 1 hour of sitting there, u tried to talk to him, but he just knocked his head. He&amp;#39;s been acting weird ever since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evening, I ordered food, and we sat down at the dinner table. I tried to have a conversation, but he was still acting weird. Then he just started telling me that he was upset because I acted as if everything was fine and that it felt as if I didn&amp;#39;t trust him. I told him that he needed to back off and that everyone grieves differently and that he needed to respect that. He got up and went to bed. It&amp;#39;s been a couple of hours, and I&amp;#39;m starting to feel bad. AITB?&lt;/p&gt;

"So, I (30m) was talking to an acquaintance (27F). Not a friend, not a partner, just someone I've talked to maybe 5 times. We got on the topic of where we lived. I live by myself in an apartment, and she lives with a male roommate who is not her partner, nor her friend. She actually tells me mostly about how he is weird (not too many details).

She tells me she has a sister (18F) who needs an apartment close to a nearby college and would split the rent. I explain a few things.

A). This is a 1BR apartment.
B). I personally don't want to live with the opposite gender that I'm not in a relationship with.

The acquaintance said my traditional conservative views (false btw. I'm moderate leaning liberal) are misogynistic and oppressive to women. She said that as a man making more money, I have an obligation to help the less financially fortunate women overcome the system that's oppressing them.

I don't have anything against her living with a man platonically. Its her choice. However, I could not live with the opposite gender platonically, it is simply not what I personally feel comfortable with. I also feel like her whole financial thing is taking feminism wayyyy out of context and way too far.

"I (15f) made my classmate (16f) cry thru text messages.
 My first year threw me a curveball with Belle, a classmate I thought was pretty cool at first. You know, online classes, cameras on, she seemed smart and kind. But then, she started acting off, making weird comments and dissing classmates.. y'know, acting like a pick me.. The drama really kicked in when my friend Carl (15m) developed a crush on her, turning our group chat into a chaotic mess.

Moving on to the second year, we're back to face to face classes. Belle, being the ""smart"" girl in our class during our first year, didn't reach the expectations she set. She wasn't as smart as she seemed during online class. She got elected as the Vice president unfortunately. Despite becoming vice president, didn't exactly hit reset on her behavior. As the class secretary, I had to work with her, and that's when things got rocky. She and Carl decided to flirt in the class officers' group chat despite it being for announcement and planning purposes only, and I couldn't let it slide. Frustration led to a confrontation where I brought up past issues due to Belle talking back acting like she didn't do anything wrong.

Kicking Belle out of the group chat stirred up more trouble. We ended up facing our adviser, and that's when Belle pulled out the waterworks. I apologized for getting too worked up, but Belle played the victim card like a pro which led to our adviser scolding us even more. Luckily, Our adviser was biased towards the situation. Moving into the third year, more people started to catch on to Belle's true colors. I tried to steer clear of drama, but my dislike for her lingered.

So, first two years – drama central with Belle, featuring attention-seeking, flirting, and some questionable tears.
I think I am the buttface in this situation for bursting out on her and saying bad things to her. But I can't take her personality anymore. We are now in our third year of high school and Carl and I made up and we are close friends again. Carl finally saw Belle's true colors and I wasn't alone on the Belle Hate Train anymore. Belle has caused a lot of problems in our class especially now. (3rd year) People started to see that she was a pick me girl and a constant liar. People got to see her victimize herself to the point where she even brought her parents when there was a problem.
It's funny how during my first year, I was the only one hating on Belle. Now in my third year, almost everyone in my class hates her. Her true colors were revealed and no one liked it. I changed now and I avoid conflicts. I don't bring up what happened in the past anymore because I find it to be immature. Just wanted to share this story because why not lmao.

"Was drinking with a group of people and some friends and it got to the discussion of where I mentioned I get super affectionate when drunk with friends. It is endless hugs, and ‘I love you’s’ to friends. Anyways I was talking with one of friends about this but how I thought it is weird to be as affectionate with male friends even though it’s coming from a platonic place. Him mentioned that it could be completely platonic and was like “let’s try it” so we did, we cuddled on the couch like fucking weirdos. I wouldn’t have done this if sober, especially not cuddling, especially not if he suggested it. And I guess a girl he had a crush on seen it and she got upset. I feel really bad and guilty and given this is the first time I hung out with most of these people, I’m worried I might’ve given them the wrong impression. I know I’m kind of blowing this up in my mind but I’m just worried about giving them the wrong impression and thinking I’m that kind of girl who would throw herself at guys. 

It was completely platonic on my end and I’m assuming and hoping it was on his side as well. I was drunk and didn’t think through how weird it was at the time. I generally hug everyone when I drink but I do understand that hugging and cuddling are very different, especially now that I’m sober. I just feel grossed out with that, like a pick me or even a homewrecker. 

I think another aspect adds to that is a lot of people there kept trying to get me to talk to his cousin, who has a long distance GF, just because he was liking me that night. From what I heard is that they were working out an open-relationship but she also called him that night worried because he was having drinks with girls there. To me that’s definitely an idea that they haven’t worked out any of the implications of their “open-relationship”. It was just wild to me that people kept tryna get me to talk to him and even try to justify it on his end, “he has physical urges”, like okay?? He doesn’t need me for that, he can go handle that himself lmfao. I just feel disrespected that people really thought I was the type to let that slide and possibly hook up with a guy who has a gf. Just because she wasn’t there. He’s so wrong for that. 

Just being in those situations I feel like people might get the wrong impression that I’m the kind of person to do that or be like that. I did call that guy out for trying to hit on me despite having a gf but for the others I’m not sure how I should handle it, or even if its that big of a deal that I should bring it up to people and apologize.

"Good evening. A few months back, my boyfriend of nearly one year decided to break up with me after a relatively difficult time in our relationship. Not going to get into details because it really doesn't matter, but to sum it up, neither of us were in the wrong and we both understood that. Regardless, when we had our breakup meeting, he handed me a bag of gifts that I had given him and things he was borrowing from me. At the time, we had planned to remain friends, so I told him he could keep it all, but he said he would rather not. Understandable, in my opinion. About a week later, he decided that he did not wish to remain friends, which was frankly quite heartbreaking, but whatever. Things between us have remained considerably cold since then.

About halfway through our relationship period, he had given me a ring, part of a matching pair. Mine had a blue gem, his had a red one. Two days ago, he sent me a text that reads ""Hey do you still have the ring I gave you bc I'd like it back."" I replied with ""Oh."" ""Sure."" I haven't had the chance to meet up with him to return the ring yet, so over the last 24 hours or so, I've been thinking about it. That ring does actually mean a great deal to me. It reminds me of the good times we had when he and I were together. Frankly, it's also a nice ring. I don't wear it anywhere, it just sits on my shelf, but it's nice to have. I haven't told him that I don't really want to give it back yet because I'm worried that I'm in the wrong here. I was under the assumption that it was a gift that I would keep regardless of whether we remained a couple or not, but I can understand him wanting it back. Am I the buttface for wanting to keep it?

Update: I texted him and told him that I’d rather keep the ring. He hasn’t responded yet, but we’ll see how this goes.

Edit: I just want to clarify that he is a really nice person, and this is a bit out of character for him.","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-02T07:51:34.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good evening.

"I (28f) and my partner (25Nb) are getting married soon. We are super excited to have friends and family join us for a beach wedding a a reception just next to the beach. I have two older brothers, John(38) and Paul(35). Paul is immunocompromised and still very concerned with Covid precautions. I don't blame him, I'm also on the same Immunosuppressant medication. I don't care if people are masking up or whatever at the party.

They went to the wedding but didn't stay at the reception at all.

"I am a biological female, but am naturally very masculine looking, to the point where I've been mistaken for being a trans woman or even a gay man on multiple occasions in the past.

I also have a friend that's conventionally very  feminine-looking and attractive. She's a strong supporter of ""just embracing natural beauty"". Last time I tried that, some drunkard wanted to beat me up for being a ""crossdressing f*ggot"".

Despite that, the friend would sometimes try to make comments about how fussy I am when I try to find clothes for myself, how long it takes me to put on makeup before we go out, or how much time I spend at the gym trying to grow my glutes. She was never forced to do any of these things to be pretty, doesn't understand that not everyone can be as effortlessly beautiful as she is, and she's otherwise a good person, so I always ignored these jabs. Just like a person from a rich family will not understand what it's like to struggle to make rent, a naturally attractive person will have a hard time relating to less visually blessed folks when it comes to looks-related topics.

Yesterday, my friend found out that one of our mutual acquaintances had gotten a BBL abroad. She was quite shocked, and could not believe that the acquaintance would go under the knife for such a dangerous procedure. She mentioned that our acquaintance should have just ""went to the gym or gotten over her insecurity, and embraced her natural curves like she (my friend) does"", to which I replied that it's easy to embrace your natural looks if they are conventionally deemed as attractive, and that I understood our acquaintance, since I went through a breast augmentation myself.

Upon hearing that, my friend was shocked. She told me that I should have accepted myself, and that it was very shallow of me to get the procedure. That she was sure I wasn't as flat-chested as I claim to have been, since ""no woman has absolutely zero breasts, or any other curves"", that I was body dysmorphic, and should have gotten therapy back then, instead of surgery. I told her that prior to that surgery, people would stare at and accidentally misgender me on a regular basis (not that they were to blame for it, I really looked like a man dressed up as a woman or a non-binary person), and getting the boob job really helped with that.

She then told me that if she had my body, she would just love it the way it is and not care what others think of it, to which I reminded her how she freaked out when she gained 10 pounds a few months ago (it all went to her butt and thighs, and was barely noticeable), and crash dieted until she got rid of the extra weight. I then said that if she had my natural body for even a week, she not only would get a breast augmentation, but also a BBL, rib removal surgery, shoulder narrowing surgery, pelvic plasty, facial feminisation, and God knows what other procedures that exist and make you look more ""womanly"".

This obviously upset her, and she promptly left my place. I now feel as if I overreacted, and was too mean to her. Is that the case?

&lt;p&gt;Upon hearing that, my friend was shocked. She told me that I should have accepted myself, and that it was very shallow of me to get the procedure. That she was sure I wasn&amp;#39;t as flat-chested as I claim to have been, since &amp;quot;no woman has absolutely zero breasts, or any other curves&amp;quot;, that I was body dysmorphic, and should have gotten therapy back then, instead of surgery. I told her that prior to that surgery, people would stare at and accidentally misgender me on a regular basis (not that they were to blame for it, I really looked like a man dressed up as a woman or a non-binary person), and getting the boob job really helped with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then told me that if she had my body, she would just love it the way it is and not care what others think of it, to which I reminded her how she freaked out when she gained 10 pounds a few months ago (it all went to her butt and thighs, and was barely noticeable), and crash dieted until she got rid of the extra weight. I then said that if she had my natural body for even a week, she not only would get a breast augmentation, but also a BBL, rib removal surgery, shoulder narrowing surgery, pelvic plasty, facial feminisation, and God knows what other procedures that exist and make you look more &amp;quot;womanly&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This obviously upset her, and she promptly left my place. I now feel as if I overreacted, and was too mean to her. Is that the case? Am I the Buttface?&lt;/p&gt;

"30m, wife is 29f. We’ve been married for 4 years and overall we have a great relationship but there’s always been one  rocky element, it’s our sex life.

We’ve had discussions over the years, at least 20 times we sat down to try and figure this out. Every time it’s felt like we finally have things figured out, but we don’t

The first talks we had were about the frequency of sex. What was 1-3 times a week went down to 3-4 times a month. I’m very high libido so this was hard for me, and she’s low libido and has some childhood trauma so this is also hard for her which I understand. We discussed how to better meet each others needs and determined that I need to do more to get her in the mood. Take her out, rub her back, talk with her, etc. I obliged. 

This worked for a while. We had more sex, she’s was more in the mood. But it slowed down again. I’d dedicate a full day to her. Spend the whole morning with her dinner date, massage, just a to be turned down every time.

One thing that bothered me was I’d ask her multiple times “how are you feeling about sex later” and get an enthusiastic response. Multiple times. She rarely told me no when I asked if she wanted to have sex, but when the time comes she makes up an excuse or she purposely falls asleep to avoid it. We’ve talked about this multiple times and I’ve told her it makes me feel awful that she can’t just tell me “no I’m not feeling it tonight”. She always leads me on to the last  minute and then has an excuse. There’s even been times where I say “hey I’ll rub your back for 30 minutes and then we could have sex if you’d like?” And she’ll be all for it until the moment I’m done rubbing her back.

I never liked this, it feels transactional, I’d even say that I hate it. BUT this is how’s she’s told me sex is best for her and I’ve obliged.

One of the last efforts I had was to try and get her to initiate more. We’ve had sex hundreds of times and she’s maybe initiated 2 times. Even when she does her way of initiating sex is by signaling me to touch her, it’s never ever been about me. I asked her to try to do that more as it’d go so far to help me feel more wanted but it’s never happened.

Over the past 2 years our sex life has dwindled more. What was 1-4 times a month is now Maybe 6-10 times a year. I’ve tried many ways to cope with this and one that’s helped is completely disassociating our relationship from sex. It takes me about 2-3 weeks but after that I feel great about it but every time we have sex it’s almost like it resets and I’m miserable for another month. I wont want to have sex for a month but then one day at 3am she’ll wake me up for sex and then the next several week I’ll feel miserable again.

It happened again yesterday. Hadn’t had sex since before thanksgiving. Then at 3 am she wakes me up wanting sex when I’m not even in the mood.  But I know it’ll be at least month or longer before it happens again. I hate it and I’d rather just not.

I’ve been thinking for a while of speaking to her about no more sex. Am I wrong for that?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-02T04:35:19.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;30m, wife is 29f.

"I’ve had my ups and downs with this roommate but I’ve decided that I want to move out since I like living alone better (I lived alone in college last year and it was really nice but that was because my roommates left home for the summer so it was just me). Moving back home isn’t an option either.

Anyway, my current roommate mentioned to me that she wanted a 4-month notice if I was planning on moving out. It’s a month-to-month lease. I've confirmed with the landlord that I won't need her permission.

\----

This was what she told me about moving out yesterday that made me go ""oh wow..."" not in a good way:

“When (former roommate) told me she was moving out to live with her bf, I admit, I was not happy for her. 

I didn’t speak to her for a week. She told me that she spoke with her friends and that a 3-month notice was too long but then she spoke with my friends and they told her how horrible roommates in LA can be. So (former roommate) said she gave me 4 months because I was like a sister to her. 

I’ll say it, when she told me she was moving out, yes I was thinking about myself. Anyway I found you (referring to me) in 2 months so that was that. She left in June so I had the place to myself for July and August and that was really nice” 

\-----

Like, I understand where she’s coming from… but the way she said this all made alarms go off in my head. I feel bad because I know how terrible roommates can be and they’re often a hit or miss, but I don’t think I could handle living there while people could come tour my room at any moment.

Fast forward to a day ago and he texts me asking if I still have it. I said yes I did. He asks for it back. I tell him I would but I spent money on cables controllers and games for it so I’d rather keep it. I did offer to let him borrow it on occasion if he wanted. 

Now he’s mad because he says it’s his and I was never meant to have it. I argued that it would be at goodwill and he would have zero claim to it if I hadn’t taken it anyway.

"I(24M) was on a blind date recently with a girl(Jane 22F) who I was introduced to by a coworker. Our date was going swell for the most part, she talked about herself and I just sat there listening and nodding my head with no clue what to say or do, she would sometimes ask questions and I would answer them to the best to my ability. 

since I was the one staying quiet Jane turned it into an issue saying quiet men are criminals and it was very suspicious of me to spend 30 mins barely saying anything, I told her why I was being quiet because I was unsure what to say. she called me a liar because my co-worker said I was a loud talkative person who always makes quips, I had to explain that even my co-worker knows when I meet someone new I am shy and timid around them until some time passes when I get comfortable, apparently that concept doesn't exist to Jane because she calls me rude then goes on a whole rant about how she thinks of me as a two faced liar who puts on masks to hide my evil nature. I looked at her confused before suggesting to her to not try and psychoanalyze me. Jane get's upset and brags how she did multiple courses on psychology and believes she can read me well

The only reason I don't like to be analyzed is because of an issue that people do whenever they meet me, they assume and project negativity onto me like they turn what is considered good qualities into negative ones(for example I am normally quiet and keep to myself if it was anyone else that's a good thing but if I do it It's bad)  idk why and if by their analysis of me is proven wrong months later they become confused and accuse me of another negative thing saying I manipulated or lied to them(that doesn't make any sense I know)

Jane throws a fit calling me stubborn and childish because according to her she thinks I care what other people think about me(No I don't just trying to avoid future problems) I tried to calm her down by diverting the subject but things kept escalating where she calls my co-worker to complain about me being ""toxic"" on our date. she left me at the restaurant after that.

&lt;p&gt;The only reason I don&amp;#39;t like to be analyzed is because of an issue that people do whenever they meet me, they assume and project negativity onto me like they turn what is considered good qualities into negative ones(for example I am normally quiet and keep to myself if it was anyone else that&amp;#39;s a good thing but if I do it It&amp;#39;s bad)  idk why and if by their analysis of me is proven wrong months later they become confused and accuse me of another negative thing saying I manipulated or lied to them(that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense I know)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jane throws a fit calling me stubborn and childish because according to her she thinks I care what other people think about me(No I don&amp;#39;t just trying to avoid future problems) I tried to calm her down by diverting the subject but things kept escalating where she calls my co-worker to complain about me being &amp;quot;toxic&amp;quot; on our date. she left me at the restaurant after that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;co-worker couldn&amp;#39;t help but laugh after I told my side of the story but I am feeling kind of bad now it&amp;#39;s eating me on the inside wondering if I did a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

"I am going to give a lot of backstory. (Like more then the actual conflict) I’m a 15y gender-fluid person (afab) and I hold many reservations against my father. I think it all really started when I was super young, my father worked in a neighboring state and the distance was far enough that he would only make the drive home on weekend. what I remember from when he was home on weekends was the he was drunk and would argue with my mom a lot. he eventually switched jobs and came to live with us everything only got worse. My parents started arguing a lot more. he eventually started making comments about my looks (I was around 10). My parents eventually got divorced and my father moved out of the house and I started to see him less and less. His drinking got a lot worse and when I was around 13 he started making perverted comments about my body. Calling me hot and saying that my new haircut makes me look “fuckable” and even though it was only when he was hammered it made me start to hate him. only my older sister knew and she had only heard it once and thought it wasn’t that big of a deal. Eventually he realized he had a problem and went to rehab. I started to repair our relationship, I didn’t trust him but I could spend time with him now that I knew he was sober. But of course (as is part of sobriety) he relapsed and it was really bad. It brought up a lot of past traumas I had and it became harder to spend time with him. It all really came to a peak however when my dad temporarily couldn’t attend work and had to move his camper to a new living spot. This sent him spiraling. When me and my mom went to give him some of his belongings he was taking about unaliving himself and saying how he needed to help me do it too where he then tried to drive my moms car (presumably to kill us both) the only reason he hadn’t was because I had been smart enough to get out of the car when he got in. Need less to say that set in stone my grudge against him. That event was the thing that sent him into his current sobriety which had lasted and has been healthy. As proud of him as I am, I haven’t forgotten all that he did. I kept a distance but was cordial with him when we hung out and I almost never denied hanging out with him as long as it was a comfortable situation. Here’s where I may be the asshole. When talking to my sister the conversation went to my father my sister said something along the lines of “yeah I’m super proud of dad and him being sober” and my response was” yeah I am too but I still hate him for what he’s done” my sister got super pissed at me after telling me I was an asshole for saying that. I get that I kind of was but she had been praising him for so long even though she know what he’s done and I was tired of it. I just want some outside opinion here. What makes me feel like an asshole is that my brother who’s had to deal with my dad longer does not seem nearly as affected as I do and my mom told me I was blowing the incident in the car out of proportion and he wasn’t going to do anything.

"I(28F) and my husband (28M) both got a job at Walmart (online orders)
I started working a few weeks before him at the pick up side.
Then we decided we would borrow my parents car and we both started working deliveries (pays a bit better than pickup side)
Last week my parents had some financial emergency and decided to sell their car.
We tried to work both in the same car (our car)taking turns to use it and our boss said we can't do that since we can't use the same license plate 

Since this job is paying for our groceries weekly and without we couldn't afford food without  it( also considering it gives us the schedule flexibility to take care of our 2 kids) one of us has to go work at the pick up side.

My husband demanded either I go back to pick up since I already worked there and that he thinks ppl who work there are inmature pricks (they are a lot younger than the group at deliveries) he says he won't stand them and that he believes that works makes him less (like he is embarrassed of falling that low) he says its the lowest position in there and that makes him embarrassed
 
( Or I stay at home so he can keep doing delivery)

I called him ridiculous, and since he'll start studying in a month (which will take up all his schedule for this job) and this course will get him a better paying job he has rn, I said I will keep making deliveries ( I wanna keep working on that as long as I can) 
Basically if he doesn't work in pick up this week we won't have enough money for groceries next week.

He took applied for the shift at pick up next week, and now he is mad at me he says AITB for making him do this, he will be ashamed of doing that job ( is the same he did before he just doesn't go delivery)
He is barely speaking to me and reminding me at every moment of the day what an BF I'm for not taking that job myself.

For a little bit of background I stopped working whenr our daughter (5F) was born and in order to bring some money to the table I used to bake and sale  (something I didn't like or enjoy but was enough to get some money for groceries), now that I finally got an outside of the house job I don't wanna give it up and it's my time to be out of the house and have a job.

So AITB?

"I (F25) have a very small collection of stones and tumbled crystals. I’m not super into all that stuff, which is why I only have a few that mean something to me. All of them are in a little pouch except for one, a “money stone”. Meant to bring good fortune/more money when placed in the far north side of your home. 

I decided for New Year’s Eve, I wanted to “cleanse” all the stones so they’d be fresh for the new year along with my freshly cleaned clothes, shoes, dishes, etc. But my money stone was gone. I asked my fiancé (M27) if he moved it. He said yes, and to check in x spot or x spot. I do, and it isn’t there. He gets up from the computer to look as well, and after a few minutes I’m getting frustrated. There was no reason to move it as it’s no bigger than a nickel and was tucked behind the lip of our entertainment stand - unseen. He has a terrible habit of moving things for no reason and immediately forgetting where he put it, then getting mad I want to find it. So naturally, he starts getting mad that I want the stone. Asking why I even need it, why it has to be that one, etc. I had food in the microwave so he said just go eat and I’ll keep looking. 

A few minutes into me eating, I realize all the bedroom lights are now off, the computer is off, and he’s in bed. I’m immediately pissed because I know he’s throwing a silent temper tantrum and pouting even though I never raised my voice/yelled at him, huffed and puffed, nothing. So I ask, “WTF are you doing?” No answer. I wait. I say, “hello?” Then he’s all somber, “just not in the mood to play.” And tells me I “ruined any kind of good mood” he was in. I told him he was the only one upset, it was him who was griping the entire time and literally put himself in a bad mood over a rock. Magically, the lights come on, computer turns on, and now he’s back playing his game like nothing ever happened.

"Hi Everyone, I could use some outside perspective. My wife and I have been together since 2015 and got married last year. We were in school for a majority of our relationship. We just bought our first house together in May. Before that, we lived with her mother for two years, so it’s been a significant change to finally live just the two of us.

Here’s the issue: We’ve been discussing starting a family, and while I’m excited about the prospect, I feel like we need more time. Living with her and her mom for 2 years especially when married for 1 of those years it didn’t give us much privacy or space to be ‘us.’ Now that we have our own place, I thought we could enjoy some time together, just the two of us, to settle in and strengthen our relationship in our new home.

I’m also aware that my wife is getting older and is keen on having a baby soon. Out of respect for her feelings and biological clock, I suggested we start trying around June or July next year. However, she’s been pressuring me to start sooner ever since we moved into our own house since may of this year. This pressure makes me feel like the bad guy for wanting to wait a bit longer.

But like I’m literally saying June ish July ish around there of 2024. Because she’s a teacher too she gets 3 months off for the summer if we can get around there she either gets paternity leave and the 3 months so maybe 6 months or a little less off which is great for both of us or just the 3 months and hey she gets to keep all the sick time she saved for emergencies and what not which is also amazing.

So, AITBF for wanting to delay having a baby for a year to enjoy some time with my wife in our new home? I’m torn between wanting to be supportive of her desires and feeling like we’re rushing into this next phase without appreciating the present.

"I (F18) went to a local gig recently (nothing exciting - local band pretty much copying arctic monkeys :P). I absolutely love music, I've been wanting to start a band of my own recently, I'm a great fucking bassist, and my friend plays the drums but neither of us can sing, nor write good enough songs so we've been looking for a mate to fill in that role. Whilst at this gig, I met this dude (m22), Noel. He was standing at the back of the room just drinking beer and typing on his phone - he was superrr awkward but I got talking to him and he told me that he writes poetry and sings a bit - which is great because that's exactly what we are looking for!!

I got noel to give me his snap, and I told him that I'd message him later on. I snapped him the second I got home, I was just so excited to have met him, we talked for a bit about our favourite bands and whatever, and some basic stuff, he told me that he worked as a clerk in an office relatively near to my 6th form, anyway conversation petered out and he stopped replying to me fully which was weird. One of my friends knows him and he gave me his phone number but he wouldn't answer the phone.

I was seriously worried about the dude, I ended up hanging round his office waiting for him to leave to ask if he was doing okay, but I guess I must've missed him coming out and only spotted him cycling back home - tried to follow him but it wasn't much use, I ended up hitting up the guy who gave his phone number to ask for his address, but he only gave me the street name. I got the bus there and knocked around asking for him until a neighbour pointed me to the right house.

He wasn't exactly ecstatic to see me, but I chalked it up to his usual awkwardness and asked him if I could come in and he let me in. We sat up in his room and he showed me his poetry, we talked, I got him to sing for me, he then made me toast after his mom came home and ordered me an uber to go home in. He was just so lovely to me, I kissed his cheek and he started blushing and acting even more awkward, which I guess must be because I am a pretty good looking person and he doesn't seem the type to go out with many girls despite being pretty.

I FaceTimed one of my friends to rave about it once I got home, and also let my bandmate know but they both acted as if what I had done had been an asshole move, they said that I should've respected Noel's boundaries and not gone to the extent that I had just to recruit someone into my band.

"One day, when I (24m) was seven years old, I was spending the afternoon at a church ""friend's"" place. I'll call him John. John and I weren't really close, but our moms were. She brought me along and told me to try and get along, maybe make his acquaintance. He was around my age and was hosting his own three friends upstairs while all the moms chatted downstairs.  
  
At some point, one of his friends decided to do some acrobatics on a computer chair for some stupid reason and busted the thing. They then proceeded to blame it on me. At first I was confused, but by the time I began pleading to my mom everyone was convinced I had not only broken the chair but also was desperately in denial and I even got a beating because of it. Needless to say that event has traumatized me somewhat and I still have trust issues that I can directly trace to it. To this day I vividly remember how coolly they lied about it and still hate them for it.  
After that, I kept my distance from John at church and just buried all my frustration. After some years, he left the state with his family and returned only last year. Last week my mom held a small gathering with some friends from the church and the bastard came too. I left the church as a teenager, but I still have some friends who go and so I like to be at the gatherings too. When he came to greet my mom and me my mom asked him if he still remembered playing with me. He said something along the lines of ""oh, it's been so long, I'm not sure I do. Do you, \[my name\]?' and I don't know exactly why but a lot of anger came up suddenly at that and I just threw my whole pint of Coke on his face. He looked confused and then got angry and left the party shortly after. The mood soured and it didn't help that I stayed and just acted like nothing had happened.  
Later, after telling my mom that I couldn't really resist the urge to do it and explaining the reason behind it, she said she didn't even remember the chair incident but that regardless what I did was unacceptable and that I should apologize. It's been a week and I feel very disinclined to apologize to John, but my mom keeps insisting that I do and now a close friend of mine has told me that what I did was really bad and so I'm wondering if I had no right at all to do what I did and am indeed a jerk for doing it.

"I am a first year student at uni and my mom (with help of my grandma) bought me a travel laptop so I could work on schoolwork while at school (we have 3 hour gaps between classes and I live near the school). 
I was suprised by it because when I they offered me this option of a gift on my birthday I refused, as I already have a laptop (but a really heavy and big one, as I needed it for more than writing documents). I used to borrow my moms laptop as it is much lighter, but besides one day in a week I only had it borrowed when she was at work, alas not using it.
 The laptop they bought for me cost around 340 USD if new, if it matters, and was bought from a family friend (he resells electronics ans this specific one used to be his) so the price should be lower. I am really grateful for the gift that was meant to help me, but for this reason i dont know how to feel. 
Before this I was thinking about buying a tablet that has a pen (the specific one costs i think 300 USD) so I wouldnt bother my mom with borrowing her laptop and so I could use it instead of bringing numerous notebooks with me, and could draw on the go when I have time.
 The laptop they bought for me has a touch screen so I was thrilled because of that. My laptop had MS Word already built in, but with the travel one i haave to use the free online version, but the functions i HAVE to use are only in the full version. I am able to pay for one-time payments (even if bigger), but not for monthly ones. The touch screen is also no help as it is not designed for taking notes nor drawing and really is basically only TOUCH screen. Plus we found out the travel laptop has trouble turning on from sleep mode and has to be always turned off and then on completely. They did not know about this when they bought it. 
I also think the family friend ""scammed"" them again and sold it for the of 350 USD price (even tho it was being used- i know that for sure cuz a photo of his dog stayed on it) and told them the og price is higher. He did that before to my grandma, sold her a laptop for 220 USD and said the og price when it started to be sold was 1350 USD (if i remember right, it is rn sold for 170 USD actually). 
I dont want to look ungrateful, because I really am grateful and touched by them thinking about me, but besides no backpain it gave me more troubles. 
If I was to replace it with the said tablet, I would do it with my own money, but would want to return the notebook and give them their money. I feel really bad for not using the notebook as much as I would want to and feel as if it was saying them that i dont care about the gift. I probably will stick to the laptop because I really dont want to disappoint.
Im really sorry for a long post, but just typing ""i dont like the laptop."" doesnt cover my feelings and points at all.

"I(20F) am from germany. and I have recently joined a group chat of my boyfriends friends- and my boyfriend is in there too and some of my friends are in there too..

They seemed nice people, until they started sending N*zi stickers and WW2/Holocaust jokes..

At first I tried to distance myself away from those and just do not talk to them (which i never rlly did since i backed off that group.
but it started to get out of hand and these jokes are not really funny. 
So my Boyfriend(20M) (since he was the one creating that group, which had no N*zi intentions and was at first a group of like classmates until they added more), sets a rule that if someone ever makes H*tler jokes, send such stickers and just cant talk properly without mentioning ""war"" ""H*tler"" ""The Jews(in a negative way)"" etc. gets kicked out of the group. and everyone knew and was understanding of that, or atleast thats what they pretended too.

Now heres the thing, A friend(F19) of mine recently joined this group and since the majority in there are men, she starts to instantly become friendly with them. Some really simp for her and she too found their dumb jokes funny and during Christmas Eve, she baled cookies with her boyfriend, they PURPOSELY drew a N*zi cross onto the cookie and send it into the groupchat.
since it was so much and a LOT of people grew tired of it, I immediatly told my friend how disrespectful that is to joke about that, and the only thing I got was
""Dont be a bitch about it"", which didnt really bother since i stand my ground. and ""No one cares about these dead people anymore"" and that comment really made my blood boil.
Not only is she ignorant to people that got murdered in KZ's and even already in their homes if not- but she also literally disrespect the victims from that timeline and it disgusted me. 
I then told her nothing and just distanced myself because there was no purpose in talking since she would get really defensive and all she do would be insulting me.

Then it happened that some guys in the roup just didnt care about those fucking rules and proceed to send more and more stuff of it, and my Boyfriend kicked them, since it was a set rule.

My (?)Friend proceeds to call us ""kindergardners"" for being sensitive about the fact that we set a rule for those jokes and that we are sensitive. and now we are not talking anymore which i see no problem with since I do not want to talk to someone who disrespects victims and try to downplay mass genocide

Another guy was proceeding to point out on my boyfriend that He only deletes those stickers because I, His girlfriend, am the problem. that I specifically told him to set that rule..
..yet a lot of people made a serious statement that they are annoyed at these ""jokes"" and just wanted them to stop.
and now some people are really pissed off at us for just not liking their sense of humor which isnt humor but disrespect..

So are we the asshole for setting a boundaries to not make fun of such a vile history and to not disrespect victims of the holocaust and WW2?","r/AmItheButtface","2024-01-01T08:28:39.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I(20F) am from germany. and I have recently joined a group chat of my boyfriends friends- and my boyfriend is in there too and some of my friends are in there too..&lt;/p&gt;

"I  (F28) have had quadriplegic cerebral palsy since birth. PT is something  I have had since birth, but it wasn't until seven years ago that I  started to be more involved in my physical therapy.

It was all thanks to Tom (M now 36), after three or four years his fiancee (F now 28) joined him.

Thanks  to them I started walking by tripod crutches. Previously I had only  moved around helped by others, and outside the house I used a  wheelchair.

At the same time,  Alice and Tom became my best friends. I could tell them anything, they  were the ones who took me out for sushi or pizza for the first time in  my life.

Tom and Alice worked in a  physical rehabilitation camp 700 km from my home, but I was there about  four times a year because they are such good specialists. In my country  (Poland) you go to such camps with your caregivers, especially when,  like me, you are not fully independent. My caregiver is my mother (F54)

Unfortunately,  in March 2022 A and T said they are changing jobs and moving to another  big city. Admittedly, we are now only 300km apart, but their new  workplace is a regular day rehabilitation office. I was in despair.  However, my mother promised me that we could always go there for a week  of rehabilitation and rent a hotel, as there would probably be one close  by. She promised that we would go there every month.

In  June 2022, Mum said to sign up for rehabilitation there. Unfortunately  we did not find a hotel close by, the nearest one from the office is 5  km away. We would have to take two buses. Mum said she was scared and  told me to cancel the booking at the last minute. My friends wanted to  assist us on the trial bus ride, but she refused.

A week later I heard her say on the phone to a friend,Sofia (F60) that she wouldn't sacrifice so much for me.

In  December 2022 my mum told me to sign up again to T and A. Sofia was  going to help her look for a hotel. Unfortunately, she did not find  anything. The boss of the  PT office offered us a hotel, but it was  still too far away for mum. However, Mum  finally agreed to take the  bus.

Unfortunately, after talking  to another friend (Ella, 54) she said we weren't going because I would  be finishing my PT at 6pm, so it would be dark and mum is afraid of  criminals. So again I had to cancel the booking.

The  friends were understanding, although their boss was furious. She  told  me that if I cancelled the booking again I would still have to pay half  the price. I never told my mum about this message.

I  think I might be a TB because I posted about it on Reddit back then,  but as her. I don't know why I did it. Unfortunately people have  discovered who I am.

They say I'm  blaming the only person who helps me and I'm ungrateful. Also I still  have PT in my city and I can go to another camps.

The boss of the  PT office offered us a hotel, but it was  still too far away for mum. However, Mum  finally agreed to take the  bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after talking  to another friend (Ella, 54) she said we weren&amp;#39;t going because I would  be finishing my PT at 6pm, so it would be dark and mum is afraid of  criminals. So again I had to cancel the booking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The  friends were understanding, although their boss was furious. She  told  me that if I cancelled the booking again I would still have to pay half  the price. I never told my mum about this message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  think I might be a TB because I posted about it on Reddit back then,  but as her. I don&amp;#39;t know why I did it. Unfortunately people have  discovered who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say I&amp;#39;m  blaming the only person who helps me and I&amp;#39;m ungrateful. Also I still  have PT in my city and I can go to another camps.&lt;/p&gt;

"This happened a few years ago but it's stuck with me. Basically, the next time I was with my (2) friends after my birthday, they asked me to buy 25 munchkins from Dunkin' for us to ""share"" because I was ""rich"" since it'd just been my birthday. I agreed since I was a people-pleaser and I like Munchkins anyway. Well, they ate 23 of the Munchkins, leaving 2 for me. Later, in a joking manner, I drew a cartoon of a pig and said something to the effect of ""this is you"" (I only sent this to one of my friends because I was much closer with her and we had that type of friendship).

"Hi! I'm posting this here because this subreddit seems to allow relationship posts.

I am going to be as objective as possible, which might make this a dry read.

We have been together for four years and cohabitate. We were in the car on our way to celebrate my birthday at his parents' house. In the course of our conversation, I told him that I loved him and I was really happy with our relationship. He said he was too. I said we were going to have a lot of fun together, since we're both graduating soon. He said something like ""yeah ... \[???\] it'll be even better when ... ... ... ... \[???\]."" Most of it, I couldn't understand, but I might have heard the word ""bed"" in there.

I asked him what he had said and he wouldn't tell me. He said that I wasn't meant to understand - he was talking to himself. I asked him why he would say it out loud if he didn't want me to understand him, and he said that guys do that sometimes. I told him that was rude, and laughed nervously. He said ""yeah, I know *you* think that."" (Probably referring to the other times I've gotten frustrated that he says things out loud that he doesn't want me to understand. His position is that it's his right, and my position is that I wish he wouldn't because it causes me a lot of stress.)

I told him it worried me that he was saying this right after we had talked about our relationship. If it was nothing, why wouldn't he tell me? He asked me how I could think he'd say something awful about our relationship, and that I should trust him. I told him that the timing was strange. He finally told me he didn't want to repeat it because it was ""crude"".

I said I didn't want to talk about it anymore and we were quiet for a while. When we arrived I hugged him and told him I trusted him, but he shouldn't scare me like that. He told me that he hadn't done anything out of the ordinary and that my emotional reaction was not normal.

As we drove home, I asked him about this again. He told me that he felt that telling me it was crude was enough information, that he didn't want to say it again because it was spontaneous and in the moment and on second thought, he didn't want to ruin the moment or hurt my feelings.

"I (19F) am autistic , my boyfriend (20M) is not - this is important to the story.

On New Year’s eve by boyfriend said to me “i am going for a pint to celebrate, just 1 then i will be off”, now with autism promises are taken very seriously - when someone says something we take it as concrete and a definite to be the fact he in detail said “only 1” i took that as an absolute.

So as you’ve probably guessed when he got home i asked how it was and he told me he had had two pints.

I got very worked up about this cuz he broke his word to me and my problem isn’t that he drank two beers, i wouldn’t have minded how many he had - it’s new years , my problem is he knows about my autism and we have had multiple discussions about how i take things as gospel and he shouldn’t say things of he isn’t gonna stick to them. 

He says i am overreacting and causing problems where there doenst need to be but i’d have appreciated the respect of him going “just going to have one more” so it wasn’t like he did it behind my back-  am i the buttface ??

"I’m kind of caught up in this weird family drama right now. Back in September this year, I (29m) married my love. My wife (29f) is Korean, and her grandparents are very kind, loving people. My wife is very, very close with them. Unfortunately, my grandmother-in-law (GIL) still suffers from the psychological impacts of the unrest in her country during the 20th century. When GIL was very young, she was separated from her own mother, and they never saw each other again.

Back in 2018, my wife (girlfriend at that time) and I vacationed in Seoul, and we stayed over at my wife’s grandparents’ home. I was shocked to discover that GIL still cries in her sleep, and she has accidentally woken me up several times with the noise of her crying. I suffered secondhand embarrassment for her, to be honest.

So right now, my grandparents-in-law are visiting our city for the holidays. While we were all figuring out the living arrangements for my in-laws’ stay in America, I got into a small fight with my wife. Basically, I don’t want her grandparents to stay at our house because of GIL’s mental issues.

I 17m have a cousin (24m) getting married in June. Was told about this ages ago but just came into my head today to check the timetable for summer exams to see. On the Monday after the wedding (it’s on a Saturday) I have a really important exam on. 

Here’s the thing. My cousin lives in England (we’re from Northern Ireland, they’ve been over to visit a number of times tho and we’ve done the same a few times. So it’s not like I NEVER see them) 

The plan would be to get a boat the Friday (I also have an exam that Friday morning as well) and Come back the Sunday. 

I told my parents like idk if I’d want to be going when the exams on Monday morning. My mum went into a fit of rage for a bit for daring even suggest it and going on about how I’m being lazy by not just studying extra hard in advance because of the wedding. Apparently it would look really bad if I didn’t go and it’s so rude “taking any excuse you can not to go” which isn’t what I’m doing. 

She then went on a bit of a rant about how I probably wouldn’t even study anyway that’s why I’m repeating one of my subjects etc. When she was finished my dad asked nicely for me to go to keep her happy (her side of the family)","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-30T18:20:42.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I 17m have a cousin (24m) getting married in June.

"This happened a while back, when I was just 13 (I'm 14 now). Our relationship was full of annoying bickering at the time, so this is basically the straw that broke the camel's back. Here's what happened:

Me (M13) and my brother, whom we'll be referring to as John, were chilling in the kitchen when he suddenly got an idea. This very idea resulted in him daring me to chuck a pickle at my OTHER brother (M16) we'll be naming Jack who was playing the PC which so happened to be right by the kitchen, which is where I'm typing from right now.

With further VERY brief consideration, I reluctantly threw the pickle, and it landed right on Jack's neck. Naturally, I booked it to the upstairs bathroom and so did John. We hid in there for about 20 seconds. but I could've NEVER expected that Jack would come through the door and CLOCK me full strength, instantly knocking me down. Neither did my even stronger brother John expected that to happen.

Fast forwarding a little bit, my dad called me upstairs about 5 minutes after that occurred and stated that I REALLY annoyed my brothers each day we spent, which I had no idea was a fact at the time. And by basically the entire family, I was renowned the butt face in that situation.

Our relationship was full of annoying bickering at the time, so this is basically the straw that broke the camel&amp;#39;s back. Here&amp;#39;s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me (M13) and my brother, whom we&amp;#39;ll be referring to as John, were chilling in the kitchen when he suddenly got an idea. This very idea resulted in him daring me to chuck a pickle at my OTHER brother (M16) we&amp;#39;ll be naming Jack who was playing the PC which so happened to be right by the kitchen, which is where I&amp;#39;m typing from right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With further VERY brief consideration, I reluctantly threw the pickle, and it landed right on Jack&amp;#39;s neck. Naturally, I booked it to the upstairs bathroom and so did John. We hid in there for about 20 seconds. but I could&amp;#39;ve NEVER expected that Jack would come through the door and CLOCK me full strength, instantly knocking me down. Neither did my even stronger brother John expected that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forwarding a little bit, my dad called me upstairs about 5 minutes after that occurred and stated that I REALLY annoyed my brothers each day we spent, which I had no idea was a fact at the time. And by basically the entire family, I was renowned the butt face in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is my unbiased explanation. Now then, I bring back the question; Am I the butt face?&lt;/p&gt;

"So my wife (39F) and I (38F) have a friend (35M) who is absolutely hooked on his phone. Looks at it during mealtimes - perhaps my biggest pet peeve - but also just on an ad-hoc basis when socialising with people more generally. He often seems disengaged and not very present as a result.

Meal time, when we invite him over for dinner at ours, is my biggest pet peeve because this behaviour sets a terrible example for our 11 year old daughter.

Recently he was over for dinner, and I joked that I'd have to get him enrolled in Google Family Link. My wife and I have Android phones, as does our daughter, so we use it for our daughter's phone. He happens to have an Android phone as well.

Anyway, he grinned and actually put his phone away for the rest of dinner.

We had him over once again last night. Before we sat down for dinner we were socialising in the loungeroom and it was the same deal: head in his phone despite (technically) being an active participant in our conversation.

I made the same joke again, which got a giggle out of my wife and our daughter. This time, he laughed too - and then said 'Sure, go ahead - I don't think you'll actually do it though'.

The moment he said this my wife was grinning again, because she knew that him saying something like that would goad me into doing it for real.

So I said 'Are you sure? You'll have all of the same rules and restrictions as our daughter'. He snickered at this and said 'Okay!'.

And that was that. I had him go into his Google account settings, and we updated his year of birth so that it was the same year of birth as my daughter. Moments later Google was encouraging him to 'find a parent to help', and several minutes later I had gotten him all set up as a supervised account in Family Link.

To be fair, I was very transparent about what would happen before doing it, and he facilitated it.

Whether this is because he didn't fully consider just what it would mean or not, I don't know. Perhaps he thought it'd be easily bypassed.

He was certainly surprised when he found YouTube Kids had replaced the regular YouTube app, and very surprised when he discovered that our daughter - and now he - has browsing limited to an allow-list of websites.

Ten minutes later, it was dinner time... And I couldn't help but giggle as I watched my wife take her phone out of her pocket, open the Family Link app, and then lock both of their phones.

 I [19M] used to be really close to one of my college classmates [19F]. She is from another city, so when she came here for college, I became one of the only people she knew here. Over the next 5 months, we became really good friends, like we would meet up before going to college and then stay late at college even after all our other friends left.  
   
Our friendship started deteriorating after these 5 months, and at this point, I started to get the feeling that she was trying to use our friendship in order to get me to help her out academically since I am better than her at it. She constantly gave me excuses for why she could not do her assignments and asked me to send mine to her so that she could copy them. Along with this, she even started asking me to send her all of my notes and stuff. After a while, she revealed to me that she is asking me for this help since she just started dating a common friend of ours and that she was having some relationship problems because of which she is unable to study.  
I told her that I don't want to get involved in the relationship since her boyfriend is also a good friend of mine, but I told her that she needs to focus in our classes as well, since otherwise she will just struggle a lot academically, and that if she doesn't, then I will stop helping her. When she did not change her behaviour after this, I stopped helping her in academics, but I still talked with her as I normally would. At this point, we had started growing distant and barely talking since she felt that I did not help her specifically and that I was being unfair.  
   
A few more months go by like this, and then one day she just randomly called me while crying. She told me that she and her boyfriend just had a huge fight and that he now wants to break up with her. This happened continuously for like a week, and after talking to her boyfriend (my friend), I realised that he was also struggling with this situation and wanted to be able to fix things.  
So I told both of them that I was ready to mediate between them and help mend their relationship, but on the condition that neither of them put me in a position where my friendship with either of them was jeopardized. So I helped them talk for a while, but things just got worse and worse until they decided to take a break for a while. Then, randomly, a few days later, her BF sends me a SS where she claims that during one of their fights, I told her that ""her BF just constantly hurts her while she is just trying to defend herself."" I never said that, but due to this, my friend is now doubting me. When I called her, she just kept justifying herself and didn't even say sorry for this.  
   
This was the final strand for me; after this, I completely stopped talking to her, and we would only interact when all the friends met up. Even if she asked me for help with anything other than her relationship, I would just ignore her.

"So me and my now husband just got married last May and this is still in my mind. All names changed for privacy.

We got engaged that April before our wedding and it took us a couple months before we decided on a date. In that time my brother and SIL got engaged (relatively quickly after us actually) and while we were incredibly vocal about our wedding date in May, I got word that they were also planning to hold their wedding in May (about 2 weeks after ours). I was pretty upset, wedding planning is a lot of work and it felt like they were trying to either one up us or get married just as fast or maybe faster. For clarification they would have 8 months to plan this wedding VS the 11 months we had (and we were already deep in wedding plans when they announced similar dates). 

We share pretty the same community group as well, so besides some differing family members it would be all the same people at both weddings. I personally didn’t express how upset I was to them, but I had a family member point out that the dates were too close. They got pretty irritated at this and basically refused to listen to the point my family member sat them down with another family member as well as me and fiancé at the time. My SIL kept rolling her eyes and sighing the entire time my family was trying to mediate. I did not ask my family to do this but they told me it would be beneficial and I agreed.

They saw nothing wrong however they eventually relented and agreed to a date the first weekend in June- about 1 day shy of a full month later. It was the best we could get so we agreed.

some background info that might be important:
-my SIL is an old school friend so we have a history
-we fell out of contact when I went to college besides FB but she was never a big poster and she wasn't a huge texter at the time. 
-she started dating my brother but I was the last to find out and she never told me
-they had been dating much longer. a couple years or more at this point, where as me and my husband got engaged 6 months after meeting and planned what I considered a rush engagement. 

Reasons I think I might be TB:
-I never approached her calmly asking why or saying how I felt
-does this really matter? I still got married, it was still a great day.
-my family members are a bit blunt so even though I didn't come up with the idea I agreed and I probably looked like the driving force.

Edit: I just want to thank everyone for the feedback. It’s nice to have some objective feedback and looking back I can see it from a different perspective.

"I (F17) got accepted in a couple of good colleges, but my choices are personally narrowed down to two. One is prestigious, but costs way more. The other I have a full ride to, excluding room and board. We are not rich, and for a while we struggled with poverty, so graduating with a bunch of debt/having my parents pay off some of my debt is a genuine concern of mine. Still, we decided to explore the prestigious school, going on a tour.

My dad knows the environment of the college better than my mom, so he took me. Now, my dad has cheated all my childhood. We all know. He has a few kids by other women. It’s shitty, and it splits our family up and overcomplicates everything, but it’s what he does. He’s also a genuine narcissist, and he really only cares about something if it makes him look good. That is why that despite the heavy debt I would graduate with, he wants me to go to the prestigious school.

When we went into the city the college is in, partially it was to meet with someone he knows that works with the school. Because my dad always has some ulterior motive, he basically briefed me to lie to the woman we were meeting with. He told me that not say that him and my mom are together, and that my brother isn’t in a group home because of his severe autism.

It became increasingly clear that he was sleeping with this woman. She was weirdly close with him, she even laid next to him on the couch. At the time, I didn’t really know what to do. I didn’t want to break my mother’s heart by telling her that he was cheating yet *again*, and I also didn’t really know what was going on until a few days later when I processed it. I’m always being used as a weapon against either parent. It is exhausting, and now I have to notify the other when one is cheating.

Now my mom and dad are fighting, and I came clean about the weirdness. That my dad painted a story that he was a single dad with only a daughter and a son, etc. Now my mom is calling me a “traitor” behind my back to my little sibling, and giving me the cold shoulder. It is so goddamn exhausting being the one caught in the crossfire. What I thought was just going to be a nice dinner with a woman while we discuss my future is now an episode of *Cheaters*. It hurts me so much that I now have to be involved with this shit, and my mom now fucking hates me because I didn’t know what to do.

I am maybe the asshole because I withheld important information to my mother. I love my mom so much, and it hurts me that I knowingly withheld information when I didn’t want to hurt anyone.

You changed my life. 💚","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-29T00:36:04.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (F17) got accepted in a couple of good colleges, but my choices are personally narrowed down to two. One is prestigious, but costs way more. The other I have a full ride to, excluding room and board. We are not rich, and for a while we struggled with poverty, so graduating with a bunch of debt/having my parents pay off some of my debt is a genuine concern of mine. Still, we decided to explore the prestigious school, going on a tour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad knows the environment of the college better than my mom, so he took me. Now, my dad has cheated all my childhood. We all know. He has a few kids by other women. It’s shitty, and it splits our family up and overcomplicates everything, but it’s what he does. He’s also a genuine narcissist, and he really only cares about something if it makes him look good. That is why that despite the heavy debt I would graduate with, he wants me to go to the prestigious school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we went into the city the college is in, partially it was to meet with someone he knows that works with the school. Because my dad always has some ulterior motive, he basically briefed me to lie to the woman we were meeting with. He told me that not say that him and my mom are together, and that my brother isn’t in a group home because of his severe autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became increasingly clear that he was sleeping with this woman. She was weirdly close with him, she even laid next to him on the couch. At the time, I didn’t really know what to do. I didn’t want to break my mother’s heart by telling her that he was cheating yet &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, and I also didn’t really know what was going on until a few days later when I processed it. I’m always being used as a weapon against either parent. It is exhausting, and now I have to notify the other when one is cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my mom and dad are fighting, and I came clean about the weirdness. That my dad painted a story that he was a single dad with only a daughter and a son, etc. Now my mom is calling me a “traitor” behind my back to my little sibling, and giving me the cold shoulder. It is so goddamn exhausting being the one caught in the crossfire. What I thought was just going to be a nice dinner with a woman while we discuss my future is now an episode of &lt;em&gt;Cheaters&lt;/em&gt;. It hurts me so much that I now have to be involved with this shit, and my mom now fucking hates me because I didn’t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

AITBF for yelling at my dad because he wants to attend a family gathering? My dad has been lonely since my mothers death that happened several years ago. He has no job and no friends since he quit and is living of his retirement funds. Recently my male cousin, lets call him John, invited all family members for a huge family gathering at his house. This is an annual thing that I have atteneded many times before.

 The relationship between John and my dad is that when my mother died he was quick to offer and help us with funeral arrangements when we were distraught and confused. So my dad respects John a lot for this. I also respected and am greatful towards him. But my feelings towards him changed when I heard from my uncles that they went to his house and John and his wife got into an argument where he punched his wife in front of them and continued to beat her up. My uncles stopped him and John got out a sickle knife and started threatening that he would hurt them if they tried to fight him. Eventually he calmed down and the ending is not so clear but my uncles went home in fear that John would kill them. This was not reported to the police because John's mother begged them not to. John's three children were there in the house when this went down. His wife is alive. It was later revealed that he has been beating his wife up for years and that he has several mistresses and flaunted the fact that he has been sleeping around to his wife.

My dad knows all of the above info but still wants to go to the party and bring me along. I said NO! And I remineded him of the horrific stuff John has done to his wife and the threat to harm/kill my uncles. My dad just said that that is a matter between husband and wife and has nothing to do with coming together to a family gathering. Stuff he said to me on this: 'Do you want me to be lonely? Why am are you banning me from gathering with my other blood relatives? Why are you 'fighting' with me on this? All your other uncles and aunts who know about the abuse situation are also coming, in fact, they were the ones who asked if I will come. Am I to spend my life alone?' etc.

 I told him right back: 'You're supporting abuse by going. How can you eat and drink and have fun in his house, around his wife when you know about the terrible things she was put through by John? If there is a heaven you won't be going to it! So much for morals, it is becoming clearer and clearer who you truly are.'

I told him he can go if he wants to go but I sure as hell will not!

"My bf invited me to a destination wedding at an all inclusive in DR. At first I didn't want to attend because I didn't know this family member of his getting married, I had just started a new job and I would not have enough leave, and because I had been planning to bank my leave for a vacation spot on the bucket list. He really wanted me to go because it meant a lot to him and it was an opportunity to introduce me to his family so I agreed.

Then a week after the event I get invoiced by him for the sunblock he bought that we shared, tips for the bar (I actually don't drink), as well as the wedding gift itself which was $400. He said I could pay him back as much as I wanted so I split the cost of tips and sunblock.

I make innaproprite jokes with one of my female friends I have a crush on, and I feel more attracted to her. But the other girl also makes me feel loved and accepted. It’s all so much to take in

My girlfriend doesn’t know I have a crush on my newfound friends and I have considered leaving her for one of them. But I still do love my girlfriend

I broke the ice by asking him a few questions and he answered each, I found out he was autistic and suffering with an anger disorder I also found out he was living alone which in my country is very unusual, I asked why and he told me his entire family does not want him around anymore, so I decided to dig deeper and ask why, he told me how his grandparents were (to simplify what he said) toxic and abusive, he was having a bad day and his grandmother was pushing his buttons by constantly staring him down after she was told by his mother to leave him alone adding fuel to flame, eventually he snapped and yelled so they decided to kick him out. I asked why he was having a bad day and he told me he was beating himself up about an event involving a fast food restaurant not listening to him when he asked for something simple but they gave him a big order which took out money from his savings. also something about his family expecting him to save up all the money by himself to build a house idk about that, he also mentioned how his uncle beat him up over a dog and he fought back I told him his uncle was in the right again you should not fight your elders

"Me (18M) and a couple of friends (18-19M) were hanging out at a friends house playing Mario Wonder. Let's call this friend Mario. We were told that his mom was home so we couldn't say anything too crazy but we could say slurs and cuss and stuff. We all said our fair share of swear words; the slurs were mostly done by Mario. I do not condone the F-slur; I used to say it in like middle school, but I don't use it and I don't think it's a word that should be said. The F-slur was said I'm 95% sure (I could be thinking about an instance earlier today where another friend said it ), and the words gypsy and retard were used, both by Mario and I think retard/retarded and the word goombah (not goomba) once by me. All of this was when Mario's mom was working right behind the couch unbothered. All of my friends were sitting on the couch and I was sitting on a chair right next to the couch. Behind the couch was the mom's bedroom through a large doorway. I could only see half of the bed from where I was sitting. 

Eventually, Mario's mom left when I wasn't looking, and when I saw she wasn't behind the couch anymore I assumed she was downstairs because I thought heard footsteps coming from down there. I don't remember all of the things I said but it was pretty much kept PG-13 other than a couple of cuss words. I think I said something about someone riding something at some point, another thing something along the lines of ""Do you think Bowser has a spiky member?"" and then later on I mentioned some Piranha Plant clouds looking like anal beads. Then another friend, we'll call him Toadette, said something like ""Is it weird for me to want to watch my wife cheat on me"", obviously to be funny, and both Mario and another friend we'll call Luigi were kind of quiet and telling us to shut up when we said these things. The final friend, Yellow Toad, was appropriate the whole time pretty much, but me, him and Toadette were all pretty loud. When we got up to leave I saw Mario's mom was sitting on the half of the bed that I couldn't see from my chair.

Now we come to the dilemma. All of us left Mario's house, Toadette and I were downstairs first with Luigi and Yellow Toad soon to follow. As we were all walking back to our cars, Luigi said Mario doesn't want me in his house anymore. I told him I didn't notice Mario's mom and he said it doesn't matter. Then I asked why would we be able to use slurs but not make PG-13 ass sexual comments. I also told him that we're adults, and dudes will be dudes. I apologized to Mario over text (because we were halfway to our cars which were already parked like 5 minutes away) soon after but he never responded. So now I know he's really pissed off at me but part of me thinks it isn't a big deal, because if he can say the F-slur around his mom why can't I talk about Bowser having spikes on his penis?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-28T00:11:17.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me (18M) and a couple of friends (18-19M) were hanging out at a friends house playing Mario Wonder. Let&amp;#39;s call this friend Mario. We were told that his mom was home so we couldn&amp;#39;t say anything too crazy but we could say slurs and cuss and stuff. We all said our fair share of swear words; the slurs were mostly done by Mario. I do not condone the F-slur; I used to say it in like middle school, but I don&amp;#39;t use it and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a word that should be said. The F-slur was said I&amp;#39;m 95% sure (I could be thinking about an instance earlier today where another friend said it ), and the words gypsy and retard were used, both by Mario and I think retard/retarded and the word goombah (not goomba) once by me. All of this was when Mario&amp;#39;s mom was working right behind the couch unbothered. All of my friends were sitting on the couch and I was sitting on a chair right next to the couch. Behind the couch was the mom&amp;#39;s bedroom through a large doorway. I could only see half of the bed from where I was sitting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Mario&amp;#39;s mom left when I wasn&amp;#39;t looking, and when I saw she wasn&amp;#39;t behind the couch anymore I assumed she was downstairs because I thought heard footsteps coming from down there. I don&amp;#39;t remember all of the things I said but it was pretty much kept PG-13 other than a couple of cuss words. I think I said something about someone riding something at some point, another thing something along the lines of &amp;quot;Do you think Bowser has a spiky member?&amp;quot; and then later on I mentioned some Piranha Plant clouds looking like anal beads. Then another friend, we&amp;#39;ll call him Toadette, said something like &amp;quot;Is it weird for me to want to watch my wife cheat on me&amp;quot;, obviously to be funny, and both Mario and another friend we&amp;#39;ll call Luigi were kind of quiet and telling us to shut up when we said these things. The final friend, Yellow Toad, was appropriate the whole time pretty much, but me, him and Toadette were all pretty loud. When we got up to leave I saw Mario&amp;#39;s mom was sitting on the half of the bed that I couldn&amp;#39;t see from my chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we come to the dilemma. All of us left Mario&amp;#39;s house, Toadette and I were downstairs first with Luigi and Yellow Toad soon to follow. As we were all walking back to our cars, Luigi said Mario doesn&amp;#39;t want me in his house anymore. I told him I didn&amp;#39;t notice Mario&amp;#39;s mom and he said it doesn&amp;#39;t matter. Then I asked why would we be able to use slurs but not make PG-13 ass sexual comments. I also told him that we&amp;#39;re adults, and dudes will be dudes. I apologized to Mario over text (because we were halfway to our cars which were already parked like 5 minutes away) soon after but he never responded.

"So I 29F, got engaged 2 months ago. My family is incredibly excited and planned a beautiful party to celebrate our engagement with my extended family. Some background on my family; I’m adopted (at birth) and connected with my birth family at 25. I asked my mother if she’d be comfortable inviting my birth mother and birth sisters and she happily obliged. However my SIL seemed less then thrilled, despite her literally not being involved in the party besides being a guest. For the weeks leading up to the party she kept making comments about how they shouldn’t of been invited as they’re not family. I ignored these comments until the day of the party when she crossed the line. 
When my birth family arrived my SIL completely ignored them, instead choosing to go from table to table and whisper loudly how terrible I am for inviting my birth family when my “real family” (her words) had planned the party. Again I chose to suck it up and ignore her rudeness and gossip. That was until she approached my birth mother and started ranting at her, telling her she’s a terrible person for putting me up for adoption and having the audacity to try and have a relationship with me. She then turned her anger on my incredibly pregnant birth sister and asked her if she was planning on “abandoning her baby as well.” 
Now this is where I think I might be the asshole. Some context, my brother (35M) got in trouble with the law a few years ago. It was pretty bad and he almost went to prison. He still has to follow a set of strict rules, such as not being within a certain amount of feet of a school. He also will never be able to adopt or foster children. 
So in a fit of extreme anger I marched up to my SIL and loudly told her she shouldn’t be talking asked her if she was so against adoption because she’ll never be able to do it since her husband is a predator. She dramatically burst into tears and left. My brother has been texting me since saying I embarrassed the both of them.

"So I 20m have a friend 19f. I thought we were close but obviously I’ve done something to piss her off in this situation.

Basically I’ve been away a few months and she said to shout her when I was back. I did and asked if she wanted to just meet up. She seemed keen on it and was like yeah. 

It got to the day we were meant to and I snapped her and she was still saying yeah in the morning, but then when I tried to message to arrange a time she opened my message but didn’t reply. I thought nothing of it as she sometimes doesn’t reply. So a few hours later I messaged again just like yeah or nah? and she didn’t even open that one and it’s been a few days and still not opened. Normally I’d just take this as yeah you don’t wanna talk I’ll leave you be but again I considered this friend proper close.

So I’m just wondering wibta if I texted her saying like what the issue is if there is one because as far as I know I haven’t done anything, we barely spoke while I was away and she was fine with me when I got back but then has randomly gone like this. My thinking is just ask to see if it is something I’ve done and then if she ignores or whatever I can just leave her be just don’t wanna lose a friend over what might be small shit. But like I said I’m shit at social stuff and dunno if I’d be being an ass by doing this.

"For a long time I (F27) figured I was safe from having to post in this sub because I have a half decent family, but today I guess they decided to prove me wrong.

Because of various health issues I've had two bouts of telogen effluvium (hair shed) since last January and will likely be having another one in the next couple months.

I have severe anxiety and depression on a good day and this whole debacle has had me spending the last 11 months as what professionals refer to as a ""basket case"". And, as many of you probably know, stress and hair growth do not go hand-in-hand. Because of the severe stress my hair has caused me, along with the likelihood that it will begin shedding again soon, I've decided to cut it and get a wig.

My few family members (mom, grandma, and uncle) who know about my hair loss were reluctant to support this because, as of now, the loss isn't terribly noticeable. However, for me this texture and general anxiety over it is more important at this point.

At this point I've cut my hair into a rough pixie cut and have been wearing a wig out in public. I plan to shave my head soon as seeing it is still triggering, and I believe I have the best chance at recovery if I get it out of my sight.

However, for Christmas dinner with my family today I decided to go without it because I knew I would likely be tired by the evening and want to lay down on the couch.

When I arrived my grandmother and uncle complimented my hair but were still somewhat supportive of my plan.

However, when my aunt arrived and commented on my hair, my grandmother remarked ""We like it more than wigs"" and proceeded to explain the situation to my aunt and talk about how I have ""Always had such beautiful hair"". Immediately my face went red and I said ""Thanks, grandma"", to which she replied that it ""wasn't a big deal"" because my aunt is family.

My face was red for several minutes and I was mostly silent for the next couple hours. My mother assumed I was angry with my aunt and seemed surprised when I told her it was my grandmother I was angry at. (My mother has also told a family member about my hair loss without my permission, but apologized when I told her it upset me.)

My mother said I shouldn't be so angry with my grandmother because other people don't understand that I don't want the subject talked about, and that I need to explain it to them myself so that they don't. This angered me more and I said I didn't want to speak about it anymore.

Once my aunt left I told my grandmother not to talk about it to other people. She hugged me and said ""Okay"", explaining that she just doesn't see the loss.(I also texted my aunt apologizing for being standoffish and letting her know I was angry with my grandmother, not her)

When leaving my mother mentioned the evening had been nice even with ""Grandma's faux pas"", and repeated what she said earlier.

"I'm 39F, husband is 43M, and children are 11M, 10F, and 7F. We do the whole Santa thing every year for our kids and every year ""Santa"" has the same expectations for them. They have to be well behaved, maintain good grades, and help with keeping the house clean.My children understand this and usually try their best. However, this year my son (Michael) hasn't really kept up with his grade expectations. He's usually the type to get straight A's and is the ""joy to have in class"" student, but this year he's been doing poorly in math and getting a C-average at best. I've tried rewards and incentives for getting good scores on work, helping him with his homework, and after school programs but nothing seems to work. 

In the beginning of December I let him know that he wouldn't get anything from Santa if he didn't get his grades up and that seemed to get him to get his butt in gear. For a bit he was starting to excel again but around the middle of the month his grades dropped again. I equated this to him thinking he's done enough so now he doesn't have to try. I tried again to help and still nothing. So, I followed through with the rules and on Christmas Eve wrapped him coal from ""Santa."" Then on Christmas day when he opens it he cried about ""being good"" and thinking Santa hated him.

We do the whole Santa thing every year for our kids and every year &amp;quot;Santa&amp;quot; has the same expectations for them. They have to be well behaved, maintain good grades, and help with keeping the house clean.My children understand this and usually try their best. However, this year my son (Michael) hasn&amp;#39;t really kept up with his grade expectations. He&amp;#39;s usually the type to get straight A&amp;#39;s and is the &amp;quot;joy to have in class&amp;quot; student, but this year he&amp;#39;s been doing poorly in math and getting a C-average at best. I&amp;#39;ve tried rewards and incentives for getting good scores on work, helping him with his homework, and after school programs but nothing seems to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of December I let him know that he wouldn&amp;#39;t get anything from Santa if he didn&amp;#39;t get his grades up and that seemed to get him to get his butt in gear. For a bit he was starting to excel again but around the middle of the month his grades dropped again. I equated this to him thinking he&amp;#39;s done enough so now he doesn&amp;#39;t have to try. I tried again to help and still nothing. So, I followed through with the rules and on Christmas Eve wrapped him coal from &amp;quot;Santa.&amp;quot; Then on Christmas day when he opens it he cried about &amp;quot;being good&amp;quot; and thinking Santa hated him. I told him blankly, &amp;quot;Maybe Santa gave you that because you didn&amp;#39;t get good grades like you were supposed to.&amp;quot; He spent the rest of the day sad as his sisters enjoyed their gifts from Santa. My husband pulled me aside later in the day and asked what was wrong with me, and I told him that he knew his expectations and didn&amp;#39;t  get the grades he was supposed to.

"My friend and I like to watch movies. We know what each other are watching, when, and how we feel about it by this movie app we like to use.

We have not seen each other since August because we live an hour from each other and are both short on gas money at the moment.

Back in October he texted me some verbalized disbelief for a recent opinion I had about a newly released movie. He was sort of critical and hostile towards me and my thoughts on it, ending it all with something sort of backhanded, “you’re lucky that I love you.”

Early November my birthday came and passed with not a peep from him.

Middle November comes and like nothing happened he sends me a message about new releases. I entertain it a little. Conversation ends kind of short. Very next day I text him that we should rewatch the very first movie we watched together as a nice little way of having a full circle moment. He replies that he agrees, saying, “I’m down, and you can give it 2 stars or some ridiculous shit.” I don’t respond.

Two weeks go by again and he sends me another message like nothing happened. I play along and end up telling him three movies I’m planning on watching soon. He says we should do one of them together. I agree, but to myself I don’t put a lot of weight on it.

Early december another separate plan falls through.

A few weeks later he texts me as a joke that we should watch a movie that we both know is not receiving good reviews. I joke back that I would rather eat staples. He says, “i mean with your taste i think you’d enjoy it.” I lightly call him out on it and shortly later say it’s okay to like different things. He responds, “that’s what I’m saying, I’m not chastising you for liking what you like.” I feel like he’s chastising me for not liking what *he* likes… I don’t respond.

Most recently, he made a public comment on one of my “reviews” explaining his distaste for my opinion. I deleted it (not then, but since then) so I can’t quote it but I remember, “How you can watch that and give it that score is just AWFUL.” And proceeds to tell me how horrible of a take it is and why, also putting in some claim about how ignorant I was. The next morning he sees that I didn’t publicly react to it and texts me, “i’m sorry if i offended you lol.” I didn’t respond to this text.

A few days ago, he (probably) saw that I watched one of the three films I agreed a month ago we could watch together. I did not intend to be malicious, but I wanted to see this movie and found that we probably weren’t going to see each other soon considering the tension and distance, and figured it was a loose gesture just like the rest of the “plans” seemed to be. He then does this maneuver (which he’s done before on a different social platform) where he unfollows me, and follows me again. I don’t know the thinking behind it; does he unfollow out of anger and then regret it, or is he just trying to get my attention?

"I (15F) had a bestfriend Josh (17M) for just under 14 years. hes parents were best friends with mine so we would often see each other a lot. sadly due to Covid I wasn't able to see him for about a year. after covid passed we decided to meet up again, this was around Christmas time 2022, this would make me 14  and him 16.   
when we arrived everything was pretty normal, we made jokes and had lots of fun, we spoke like we saw each other yesterday. it was pretty hot out and I did bring my swim suit so we decided we would walk down to the pool and our parents didnt mind. he lived in a complex so we could safely walk down to the pool, this also meant that the pool was far from where our parents were but I didnt see this as a problem at the time. 

  
we swam and spoke about shit and after some time he got onto the topic of his girlfriend, she lived over sees and they met through discord (i personally dont think she existed/ he might have been getting catfishes) he spoke about how they had gotten into a fight about something I dont remember and he tells me ""I wanna ask you something but can you keep it a secret"" I told him I could as I wasn't thinking anything bad. he then got closer to me  and ask me to help him with his cucumber. I immediately told him no way and he asked me why not! I told him I just dont want to and I dont need to give him a reason,  he then told me he was only joking and to relax, but I'm positive he wasn't joking. I tried to be calm and i kept telling myself it was just a joke. we moved onto another topic and I slowly started to forget about what he asked. 

  
fast forward to 3 hours later, I'm sat in his bedroom and we are playing Minecraft and talking. He got back onto the topic of his girlfriend again and long story short he ended up asking if he could grab me in my special place. I told him no and again he asked why, I told him I dont owe him a reason and I dont want to be touched. He went silent and I began to realize the situation I was in. 

  
he is twice my size, height and triple my weight, his door was locked and his curtains were closed, his window also had burglar bars. I dont think he would have taken advantage of me but to be in that situation and that setting as a girl scared me. I sat there in silence and almost like a godsent my mother knocked on the door, he unlocked the door and my mom asked if we wanted anything to drink. he was about to close the door after saying no but I said I needed the bathroom. 

  
I managed to leave and I whispered to my mom to ask us to leave as I was super uncomfortable. When we got home I messaged Josh telling him off for everything he did and said to me, I then blocked him. I also told my mom and dad about it, knowing my dad would fly of the handles. he messaged his parents everything he had said too me. 

  
now in 2023 I was telling one of my newer friends this story and she told me I was way to harsh, but I dont think I was.

"I (19f) came back from a gap year sooner than I was meant to due to health issues. Going home was very hard. I had to go through long lists of doctors and sadly only knew the basics of the language spoken there.

&amp;#x200B;

HF and I got along really well at first, I only had to clean up after myself and teach their young kids (2-5y) my native language. We talked, compared our cultures and fixed our language barrier. But soon HP left the house and often never told me at all - only their maid would notify me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then 'the shower incident' happened. HB filmed me in the shower and made up some stupid excuse, I decided to just tell his father what happened because I didn't feel comfortable talking to him alone. HP, HB and me had a talk about this and all of them apologized but HM took the time to insist on me spending more time with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't see the family much after this and soon my health issues began. So I told HP directly in their language: 'I'm not feeling well. And I'm returning to my country'.

&amp;#x200B;

They argued but accepted it reluctantly and after this I started planning to go home.

&amp;#x200B;

Working 8 hours every day with little children without breaks, constantly going to doctors and and my condition made me feel extremely tired. In fact, all I ever did when I came home was sleep. On weekends was sleeping 18 hours a day.

&amp;#x200B;

One evening, I got the confirmation that I was going home in just two weeks. The same evening HM asked to have an conversation with me and gave me an ultimatum to be better or she would complain about my behavior. She insulted my family, called them \*ssholes and told me I was making her uncomfortable in her own home and that I was an ungrateful breat.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to stay polite, so I apologized for making her uncomfortable and being a brat and told her that I could sleep in an office of my organisation. But she insisted on wanting to fix this, fix me. And after telling her that there is not enough time to fix this, she accused me of keeping my plan of leaving a secret.

&amp;#x200B;

She left with her 'threat' on telling on me and reminded me that after the shower incident we have to separate our clothes because her son 'isn't behaving when my clothes are near theirs). I don't even want to know what that means.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I was at the doctor's with a person from my organisation and I asked them If I could sleep in the office for the next weeks, explained the situation and they agreed. Apparently HM didn't actually want to follow through with her threat because she tried to avoid any texts or calls from my organisation.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved out and the only one I said goodbye to was the maid but I was closest with her anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about blocking the entire family. But my parents told me that would be a sh\*tty thing to do and I actually have to write them or at least the host father a message explaining my pov - but I don't want to. I never want to speak to them again.

"To start off, I (32F) have ADHD and ARFID(where food textures causes anxiety). I’ve had both my entire life. Most people think I’m just picky but I usually can always find something to eat wherever I’m at. 
For Christmas, I originally suggested for us to have a brisket and asked if my sister wanted to split it. My sister (35F) and my BIL declined bc of money so then said I would pay for it, given my ED/pickiness. 

I drove 22 hours to be home for Christmas - fast forward to my sister calling me the day before Christmas Eve, she told me we were having pork ribs and bbq chicken. She said she knows I don’t eat pork (haven’t for 10 years) so she would make me bbq. I said thanks, but I don’t like bbq chicken and what happened with us having brisket? 

She then proceeded to scream at me, calling me selfish and that I’m making Christmas about me and not focusing on my 3 nephews (her children). She then proceeded to bring up any drama we’ve ever had in our lives with one another(it’s always been a little strained). Calling me ungrateful and then continuing on about how my behaviors are unsafe to be around the children (I was just home for my 1yr old nephews bday in Oct and helped set everything up). And uninvited me to Christmas.  

I rarely drink, I have a solid job and am well rounded IMO. I’ll admit I was a partier when I was younger but have grown and have been in therapy for the last year. She has even stated recently how much I’ve changed over the years. My mom asked for her to calm down but she continued on saying awful things and how I am flying off the handles when I wasn’t yelling. I raised my voice a little to try to get her to hear me because I was willing to just bring something else

After a day, I called and said I was sorry that I made her feel that I was ungrateful. I said that I was just wanting them to know that if they’re making this meal specifically for me, then to not do so because I wasn’t going to eat it. I felt that it would’ve been more rude for them to do that and then me not eat it.

She then reinvited me but said I needed to take the opportunity and prove myself to her to be involved in future family functions.

I declined because I felt this was very manipulative and gaslighting because I didn’t do any of the things she was saying I did and have nothing to prove to her. 

Now she and my BIL are saying I’m ruining Christmas by not attending the family events and being there for the kids. I don’t feel comfortable having her analyze my breathing and don’t have anything to prove.

Am I the asshole for skipping out on Christmas?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-25T16:36:06.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start off, I (32F) have ADHD and ARFID(where food textures causes anxiety). I’ve had both my entire life. Most people think I’m just picky but I usually can always find something to eat wherever I’m at. 
For Christmas, I originally suggested for us to have a brisket and asked if my sister wanted to split it. My sister (35F) and my BIL declined bc of money so then said I would pay for it, given my ED/pickiness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove 22 hours to be home for Christmas - fast forward to my sister calling me the day before Christmas Eve, she told me we were having pork ribs and bbq chicken. She said she knows I don’t eat pork (haven’t for 10 years) so she would make me bbq. I said thanks, but I don’t like bbq chicken and what happened with us having brisket? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then proceeded to scream at me, calling me selfish and that I’m making Christmas about me and not focusing on my 3 nephews (her children). She then proceeded to bring up any drama we’ve ever had in our lives with one another(it’s always been a little strained). Calling me ungrateful and then continuing on about how my behaviors are unsafe to be around the children (I was just home for my 1yr old nephews bday in Oct and helped set everything up). And uninvited me to Christmas.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rarely drink, I have a solid job and am well rounded IMO. I’ll admit I was a partier when I was younger but have grown and have been in therapy for the last year. She has even stated recently how much I’ve changed over the years. My mom asked for her to calm down but she continued on saying awful things and how I am flying off the handles when I wasn’t yelling. I raised my voice a little to try to get her to hear me because I was willing to just bring something else&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day, I called and said I was sorry that I made her feel that I was ungrateful. I said that I was just wanting them to know that if they’re making this meal specifically for me, then to not do so because I wasn’t going to eat it. I felt that it would’ve been more rude for them to do that and then me not eat it.&lt;/p&gt;

"Okay so I (19f) was eating Christmas dinner with my grandmother, stepdad, and aunt. 

Basically we were talking about me and my bf who are planning on getting married once we’re finished school (at 24). 

My aunt was annoyed because she thinks we are too young to even be thinking about marriage. 

To try and justify this, my stepdad said in this mocking tone “well you know her, her only purpose in life is to have kids and be a mom.” Which instantly rubbed me the wrong way as I am currently pursuing two degrees at once (business and comp sci) and have hopes to get a job which I don’t plan on quitting upon marriage or kids.

So I said something along the lines of “uh no it’s not. I’m planning on making money and going into an actual job. That’s a really misogynistic thing to say”

To which my aunt said “what’s wrong with being a mom?”

I corrected myself and said “there’s nothing wrong with it but to say that that’s my entire purpose when I’m 19 and am relatively accomplished with two degrees while he has literally nothing, is misogynistic and offensive” (this guy literally lives with us rent free and barely works and doesn’t even really help out around the house).

My aunt retorted that my generation is “too sensitive” and gets offended “too easily.”

Then my grandmother said that my stepdad meant it as a joke to which I said “okay then he should apologize cause I didn’t take it that way.”

My aunt said “what for?” And I said “for making a mistake by saying something sexist that was taken the wrong way.” 

 Basically at this point the rest of my family sitting around the table clued in and started laughing at me.

I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong rn and should apologize basically. It’s rare that my aunt takes my stepdads side since he tends to be an actual asshole to everybody most of the time.

"So it’s Christmas morning! I am 21 years old and honestly not really expecting anything at all. My mum all year has been telling me how she is poor despite the fact she spends all her money on alcohol because she has a problem. Today of all days I thought this wasn’t going to be an issue because it’s Christmas and I have given birth to her grandchild so even more reason to put effort in. 

She hands me a card to both me and my partner and it’s twenty pound to split between us. I found out earlier she spend hundreds to fix my older sisters car, and she gave my other sister twenty pounds so as much as my younger sister wasn’t doing too good in the Christmas department she still got ten quid more than me lmao. It beats the year she gave me a tshirt though. 

We all went to effort to buy my mum something she would enjoy, we always have funny presents so we got her a wolf hoodie which cost double what she got me and thought was put into it. When I mentioned I was happy with the nicer gifts from my son’s other grandparent she became annoyed and said it was because she was poor. I casually mentioned how she LITERALLY cleared the wine shelf at the shop of the last 6 bottles yesterday which was somewhat more expensive than the gift she gave me. As well as this she gave my son a Christmas set for a 6 month old that’ll only fit him for a short time in July next year… 

I don’t have a problem that she gave me a small gift. It’s that it was unthought of, and a lie that she had no money to put thought into presents this year. I jokingly said “Oh my gift will get me a packet of nappies… thanks I guess!” And now she’s saying she feels useless and everyone’s making me out to be ungrateful, but I am sick of her being an alcoholic getting in the way of putting real effort and money into important holidays.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-25T12:28:09.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s Christmas morning!

"I (19f) live in a small town and work in one of the only diners—which is a popular hangout spot for the local teen population. I have a regular(15m) who obviously has a school-boy crush on me but has never been openly flirty or anything.

On my boyfriend’s(20m) lunch break he’ll come and eat there on a normal day and has never met my regular but has heard me joke about him before.

3 days ago, both were in at the same time since school is out for winter break. I noticed my regular was being quieter than usual even though he was with his friends and when he finished his meal, he came up to me. He was very clearly embarrassed but asked me if I would be his date to a formal that’s coming up soon. I kind of laughed him off and said something along the lines of “I’m very flattered but I think I’m a bit old for you. But a handsome and sweet guy like you? You’ll have no problem finding a date.” He apologized for asking but left with no problem.

At first, I thought this interaction was innocent enough and was laughing as I went up to my boyfriend but he was clearly fuming. I asked him what was wrong but he said I “emasculated him by not letting him handle that boy flirting with me in front of him” and “that I should have shut him down months ago and not continued flirting with him.”

I didn’t want to make a scene at work so I just left him to stew and we argued about it when we were both home. I tried to explain that I would never be flirting with the regular because he was just a kid AND I was in a relationship but he’s very insistent that I was leading the boy on and that he should’ve been left to handle things ‘because he needs to learn what happens when you flirt with somebody else’s girl.’

He’s still upset today and now I’m starting to think I might be in the wrong because it’s true, I did know my regular had a bit of a crush on me but continued being friendly with him. Not to mention I’ve never actually mentioned my boyfriend to him—nor did I let him speak up when I got asked to the formal. I don’t know, I just didn’t think it was that big of a deal.

" Hello reddit, I'm (17F) and my half-sister (20F) wants to cut contact with our mother (38F). So, my situation is a bit interesting as both me and my sister Mia (not real name) don't live together, there are legal curcumstances for this which were beyond my mum's control. But, when my sister turned 18, I had gotten into contact with her. This was over on Instagram and Mia was happy to talk to me and our mother. Mum has tried to ask Mia if we can meet up with her (we live 4 hours away) and we have seen her twice. Now, Mia had reached out to me and said she wanted my opinion on cutting contact with our mum.  


Before Mia was 18, we legally could not see her as our legal system had screwed us over, there's a lot of reasons for that, but I'm not 100% on what has happened. I'm just trying to remain unbiased. But, Mia told me that she wants to cut mum off because to Mia it feels like mum ""flaunts me around more than her"" which, yes I do understand it can seem like the case. But it isn't. I have seen that mum loves us both equally and that it can come across as favouritism because I live with mum, and she doesn't. Now, I said to Mia that I don't think it's a good idea to cut contact with mum personally.  
Though, mum was made aware of this conversation with Mia because mum was in my room and she had seen the messages. Mum didn't know Mia had changed her phone number, the reason we knew was because we were told, and mum wanted to gift Mia a $25 gift card.  


My dad now knows (42M) as I had told him because I didn't know what to do. I know that it's Mia's decision and she did want my advice. Though, I know Mia was told something by one of her family members as apparently mum had tried ""to take my nan's credit for looking after me"" which, mum never did. Mum has never said that Mia's nan didn't look after Mia or anything. And that mum contacts Mia when ""it benefits her, or when she wants to look like a good mum"" which, I have seen the text messages, that is not the case as Mia contacts mum for money and mum usually does give Mia that money, when she doesn't is because she can't afford to.  


My dad is upset with Mia for wanting to cut contact as both mum and dad gave Mia opportunities to ask questions and anything she needs to know.

"EDITED!!

I (18F) have been riding horses my whole life. I met a friend, let’s call her Carly(17F) a few years ago who also rides horses. Last week, she texted me asking if I could ride her horse for her while she’s in Hawaii for two weeks, and of course I agreed. She brought me on a tour of the stables and showed me where everything was before she left. 

The day she left, me and my boyfriend (17M) went so I could ride her horse for the 2nd time (she let me try on my tour of the stables to see if I would be a good fit) and all was well. The horse was pretty antsy, though, which made me nervous. Fast-forward 45 minutes and the horse went psycho and threw me off, leaving me in the hospital overnight with a moderate concussion and a fractured tailbone. 

Carly texted me the day after, berating me about how things were left and so on and so on, to which I explained her horse left me in the hospital and anything left was by my boyfriend who knows jack about horses and was just trying to get me to the hospital. 

Last night, she texted me again saying something of hers broke while I was using it and she wants me to pay for the whole thing. It’d be around $100 or more to replace the broken item, which ultimately only broke because her horse lost his sh*t and went buck wild for the fun of it. 

My parents said to refuse and to in return, ask her to pay my mum for the clients she had to cancel to spend the morning in the hospital with me, which I thought was fair. 

AITB if I don’t pay her back?


[EDIT]
I feel like there’s a little bit of confusion around the events that happened that I wanted to clear up to give people a better image of what happened. 

Moose (the horse) wasn’t nervous, he’s just a bit green and he was excited to get his energy out. I let him run around a bit before I mounted him because he has no knowledge of being lunged, has never been lunged before, and decided I was not the person to start that learning process with him. I was told specifically to ride him, not to lunge him, 3-4 times a week for two weeks. 

Due to the concussion I got, I couldn’t text Carly and let her know about anything that happened because my parents hid my phone in the safe, knowing I’d go looking for it. The second I got it back, I replied to her dozens of texts about how disappointed she was in me and how careless I was. 

I AM A CONFIDENT RIDER. I’ve ridden green horses, I’ve ridden horses with not much training. Moose has competed a lot in the past and I’ve seen him work, he’s an amazing animal, but something happened that day that made him snap. 

It was out of the blue, there were no warnings. Of course I don’t blame him, because there was definitely something that must’ve made him do that, but I feel as though neither of us are to blame, and that nobody is, for that matter. It was an accident on everyone’s part. 

I hope that helps some opinions in the comments. ","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-25T07:14:42.000Z","post","META","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDITED!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carly texted me the day after, berating me about how things were left and so on and so on, to which I explained her horse left me in the hospital and anything left was by my boyfriend who knows jack about horses and was just trying to get me to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, she texted me again saying something of hers broke while I was using it and she wants me to pay for the whole thing. It’d be around $100 or more to replace the broken item, which ultimately only broke because her horse lost his sh*t and went buck wild for the fun of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents said to refuse and to in return, ask her to pay my mum for the clients she had to cancel to spend the morning in the hospital with me, which I thought was fair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AITB if I don’t pay her back?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[EDIT]
I feel like there’s a little bit of confusion around the events that happened that I wanted to clear up to give people a better image of what happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moose (the horse) wasn’t nervous, he’s just a bit green and he was excited to get his energy out. I let him run around a bit before I mounted him because he has no knowledge of being lunged, has never been lunged before, and decided I was not the person to start that learning process with him. I was told specifically to ride him, not to lunge him, 3-4 times a week for two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the concussion I got, I couldn’t text Carly and let her know about anything that happened because my parents hid my phone in the safe, knowing I’d go looking for it. The second I got it back, I replied to her dozens of texts about how disappointed she was in me and how careless I was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I AM A CONFIDENT RIDER. I’ve ridden green horses, I’ve ridden horses with not much training. Moose has competed a lot in the past and I’ve seen him work, he’s an amazing animal, but something happened that day that made him snap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was out of the blue, there were no warnings. Of course I don’t blame him, because there was definitely something that must’ve made him do that, but I feel as though neither of us are to blame, and that nobody is, for that matter. It was an accident on everyone’s part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that helps some opinions in the comments. &lt;/p&gt;

"I know I sound so spoilt but let me defend myself. I (16F) live with my sisters (10F) and (5F) and my mum. My dad, who isn't usually in the country, and my mum, whom I love dearly and talk to constantly, has her flaws as she is human but so do I and I don't care cause she's always there and I love her for it. Anyways, she does this gimmick every year that she isn't getting us any presents but because of how things were going this year I actually believed her and accepted the fact that I wouldn't get anything this year because I don't mind going without presents as I have done so before on birthdays and Christmases and it's ok because I understand it is slightly immature of me to expect something always.

This Christmas I got 30 pounds from my grandparents and I spent this and the other 20 pounds I have saved on presents for 8 different people by the way because aunts and grandparents and whatnot came to visit. I don't have a job so this was all I had. When we unwrapped presents I gave everyone their presents and I got three presents: nail polish with 3 pounds and a perfume. Which, I was grateful for until I saw what my sisters got. The perfume I got was at most worth 20 pounds and I could tell wasn't very well-thought-out my sister's presents were worth around 60 pounds ish each and they got a joint present that was about 70 pounds.

I want to emphasize that my problem isn't the price, although that does add insult to injury, the problem is that it clearly wasn't bought with me in mind because I don't want any actual perfume and have never expressed wanting any and I talk about my nail obsession constantly AND I've been a bookworm basically since I came out of the womb. These things aren't very expensive and could be around the same price so they really had a vast choice of things to buy. The gift I liked most was the nail polish and 3 pounds from my sisters which was less expensive but clearly was thoughtful and bought ACTUALLY with me in mind. It just hurts because I spent hours agonizing over what to get my family members and it feels like they smelt two perfumes and chucked this one in the cart because it smelt nicer. I just want to clarify I still tried my best to act as excited as I possibly could because I am not a complete ingrate but I couldn't hide my disappointment.

Also, I am autistic and both my parents know this so I can't always produce the best reactions. Also, I have special interests (nails, ballet, psychology, and books) which I won't stfu about but I didn't get anything related to those things. Anyways, my parents could see my visual disappointment and seemed upset that I didn't like my presents and I feel really bad about it because even if the gift wasn't necessarily thoughtful at least they got me one, you know?

"I (25M) and my fiancé (25F) are getting married next year, we have been engaged for a couple years and together for over 8 years. Save the dates went out in May for people we wanted to have at the ceremony, including to these family friends. We’ll call them B and R. B has been my mum’s best friend for over 40 years, they went to school together, B and R’s daughter is one year older than me and 2 years younger than my sister, we all grew up together, went on holidays together well into our teen years, spent nearly every other weekend at their house growing up. These are people who aren’t blood family but I would consider them family because of how present they have been in my life. My fiancé also knows B in a professional manner but they love to chat and B has referred to me as ‘like a nephew’ multiple times in their conversations.

We hadn’t had an RSVP from B and R which I thought was odd as we’d heard back from their daughter who is very excited to have received an invitation and is coming from another country to attend. My mum still sees B almost weekly, so I asked her about it, if B had received the invite in the post? I was a little shocked when my mum said B had received the invitation but they were thinking of booking a holiday around that time. Nothing had been booked at the time, if it had it would have been understandable and I wouldn’t have wanted them to cancel. 

We waited a couple months for an RSVP and did not receive one. I asked my mum to bring it up in conversation with B casually in case she forgot. 5 months later B and R said they were booking their ‘once in a lifetime holiday’ so we got our answer and we gave their spaces to some +1s. They made their choice, but I can’t lie I was upset, their holiday was a multiple country tour which sounds amazing but it runs yearly and you don’t get more ‘once in a lifetime’ than a wedding.

Here’s where the real issue starts, recently they are considering cancelling their holiday because one of the countries they are meant to go through had a notice from the UK government not to travel there and their insurance will not cover them. My mum is fully aware that their ceremony/meal spaces have been given to +1s, but she asked if they would be welcome at the reception if they did cancel their holiday. I said no, we are not a back up plan or a 2nd option. My mum tried to say that’s not what’s happening. I was firm that the answer was no, regardless of what she thought the situation was, to me and my fiancé it seems like we are the 2nd option. My mum seemed a little surprised at my response and said we wouldn’t speak of it ‘for now’. My fiancé has been fully supportive of my response, she is aware that I am a bit of a people pleaser for my family so to have me stand my ground for once is a nice feeling, especially when she’s in my corner too.

"tldr; aitb for getting real angry with my sister for leaving a messy brownie plate out in front of my stomach-sensitive cat (which he then ate from) after telling her multiple times that she needs to be more careful &amp; clean after herself? (also merry christmas yall)

i (24f) adopted 2 cats in june of this year, they are both barely a year old. one of them has a lot of health problems that i only learned about after i took him in, including atopic dermatitis, gi parasites, and food sensitivities. he is barely 7lbs and i am still struggling to figure out what foods he can tolerate without vomiting and ruining his poops - so far, he can eat chicken and turkey, but no beef. tldr his stomach is extremely sensitive &amp; he has been a costly investment that i was not really prepared for. still, he sees the vet very regularly so please don't insinuate that im neglecting him or whatnot (i know reddit folk tend to jump to those types of conclusions). 

my cats &amp; i currently live together with my sister (22f). she is not really an animal person but she is coming around to my boys; she even mentioned wanting to get her own cat to me a few days ago. i did not know we'd end up living together when i adopted them but it's been fine, all things considered. because of my cat's stomach/health issues i have told my sister that she cannot be leaving food around that he can get into, &amp; ive informed her of what is/isn't toxic to cats in general. we are both stressed-out healthcare students so she tends to be neglectful with cleanup and i handle most of it in order to keep my boy's stomach in order. she leaves out hot chocolate mugs, soup plates, glasses, etc and sometimes i dont even find out until later. i have told her multiple times she needs to be better about cleanup both for my sake and (more importantly) for the cat's.

today, she left a brownie plate out - she finished the brownie but there were some small chunks left in it. i didn't realize what she'd left out until my cat got into it. i got incredibly frustrated and scared for my cat eating chocolate so i blew up at her, told her she cannot be so careless, and that i will be in a tough spot financially if he gets poisoned. i admit that involved heavy profanities because i am frankly fed up with her being so damn messy and me having to pull extra weight as a result. she got real pissed, called me an idiot and downplayed the whole thing, making me out to be overdramatic. my other sister (18f) only intervened to tell me to calm down, and to show me some website that said my cat would probably be fine with the amount of brownie he ate. which is great ofc but it doesnt change her carelessness imo.

"So here’s my issue, on the 23rd one of my niece’s pet rats died and in early December my mother’s pet bird which she raised from a hatchling died in a terrible accident. So it’s safe to say this December has been a very grief filled one, the whole family has had it very hard because of how attached they are to their pets.

Now onto the problem, one of my cats has died. He was somewhat old, not well, and while everyone else didn’t really realize it, I knew his time was probably going to come sooner rather than later. On the 23rd - the same day the rat died - I found my cat had died in his sleep. It’s now about 16 hours later and I haven’t told anyone, his body has been wrapped and placed in a cardboard box and is out on my balcony (I live somewhere with extremely cold winters so decomp isn’t something I’m worried about atm) The vet offices are closed for the holidays now, so bringing him in for cremation isn’t an option unless I bring him to an emergency vet and well, I’d say the emergency is over at this point.

It’s Christmas Eve and I don’t want to upset the family more, but I also feel terrible because they don’t know why I’m looking upset (I say it’s just a bad day) meanwhile I have my dead cat hidden out in the winter air on my balcony away from the family. It’s a terrible situation, things shouldn’t be allowed to die at Christmas time but unfortunately the universe isn’t that kind.

WIBTB if I waited until after Christmas to tell the family about my cat, sparing them the pain of yet another loss?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-24T17:57:08.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s my issue, on the 23rd one of my niece’s pet rats died and in early December my mother’s pet bird which she raised from a hatchling died in a terrible accident. So it’s safe to say this December has been a very grief filled one, the whole family has had it very hard because of how attached they are to their pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now onto the problem, one of my cats has died. He was somewhat old, not well, and while everyone else didn’t really realize it, I knew his time was probably going to come sooner rather than later. On the 23rd - the same day the rat died - I found my cat had died in his sleep. It’s now about 16 hours later and I haven’t told anyone, his body has been wrapped and placed in a cardboard box and is out on my balcony (I live somewhere with extremely cold winters so decomp isn’t something I’m worried about atm) The vet offices are closed for the holidays now, so bringing him in for cremation isn’t an option unless I bring him to an emergency vet and well, I’d say the emergency is over at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s Christmas Eve and I don’t want to upset the family more, but I also feel terrible because they don’t know why I’m looking upset (I say it’s just a bad day) meanwhile I have my dead cat hidden out in the winter air on my balcony away from the family.

"my husband (27M) and i (27F) are currently living with my in laws as our house is under renovations. we agreed to pay rent till the renovations are complete.

my FIL (59M) declared that he will give us a tv as a house warming gift. my husband and i didn’t care much for one and were more concerned with other necessities such as a fridge and washer etc. so we just told them to get any they are comfortable to get us. 

a trip to the shop later, FIL was so overwhelmed by the salesperson that he told us, “here’s 2k, go knock yourselves out”. 

after much deliberation, my husband and i decided on a 2.2k tv. if we didn’t have the 2k promised by my FIL, we wouldn’t have gotten one at that price. 

here’s where we hit a bump. FIL *said* he would give. we failed to realise he did not have the GTG from the MIL. 
MIL controls the finances of the household. 
in the grand scheme of things, 2k isn’t a lot but it is at the moment, dealing with renovations and purchasing other appliances…

so we raised up this concern and suggested if we could compromise by not paying rental to reach the 2k FIL promised. 
MIL says that’s a “ridiculous” idea and the 2k was a “goodwill” on their part while the rental was determined. now the argument is leaning towards them not paying the 2k.

"I don't get along with my bf's sister. My first introduction with his sister years ago went fine in my eyes. We were at a fair and my roommate (mutual friend of hers) actually found her brought her over and introduced us then we had a very basic convo and it was over quick. Days later my bf said his sister was telling her friends and everyone that I was weird and awkward and I was eating chili fries off by myself. Which I sort of was because just seconds before I went to a stand to order the fries before they found me again. My roommate was there for the conversation she didn't think anything odd about it. I'm not super outgoing and maybe a bit on the quieter side so I was thinking she must have picked up on that quickly and didn't like that. Anyways, since then if I walk by her I will say hi and she will pretend not to see me in their house or out and about. When I have dinner with the family any time I speak or ask someone a question I can see her make a face to her bf. 

Fortunately, my bf says all his other family members love me and they always extend an invite to things. His friends like me as well so we're good for the most part. But he said it would be ideal for his sister to like me. Funny thing is for the last year he hasn't even gotten along with his sister because they had an argument about chores or something and she hasn't talked to him since. 

My bf agrees his sister is rude but told me I need to make more of an effort to be more outgoing and get along with her. His family has also noticed the tension and said it needs to be resolved. No one has spoken to her about it. AITBF if I just let her be.

"Me(18M) and my gf (18F) are in a bit of scuffle because i've kept a secret about one of my female friends due to me being scared of a reaction. For context we've been dating for around half a year, and we've had a bit of a rocky relationship since the start. She has a lot of trust issues due to her past relationship and i've been pretty supportive in assuring her i'm there for her. I (and she agrees with this) tend to deal with most of the shit in the relationship. Arguments tends to lead to mostly she's dishing out insults and I just kind of take it, because I don't really want to fight back or make things worse then they already are. i'm a very non-confronting person and when we get into arguments I kind of tend to shut down, and she kind of takes this into her own interpretation on what she believes happened (assuming things I did, etc.)

Some other contexts, this friend I have i met when I was already dating my gf, we have same major, same classes etc, and we have a mutual friend that we work on hw together and what not. we are in the same club and a lot of our conversations are about school, it is purely platonic

My gf has called herself a ""jealous"" person in the past, and has mentioned that if I had female friends she would be upset and jealous. Keep in mind, I dont want to keep this a secret and it wasn't like i was having some secret affair which she thinks i'm having, but I knew because of the reaction she would have, it wasn't worth all the stress and emotion, so i just didn't say anything about it. Fast forward a couple months, we're out on a date and this friend texts me, responding to a msg like 2 days ago. And she just completely shuts down, I ask her what's wrong, she doesn't answer, and the whole mood of the date is just ruined. I'm driving her back home and then she starts talking, accusing me of cheating, or implying it heavily, and we kind of have a standstill and stop talking.

Next day she texts me and starts saying things like ""are you texting her?"", ""you probably like her more then me"", that kind of phrasing. she doesn't ask me who she is, she immediately jumps to a conclusion that i'm cheating on her, or to that effect. I deny it of course, because it's not true, but she turns very passive aggressive at times, and accusatory, when I don't even get the chance to explain it without being interrupted and accused. And we've been ping balling back and forth of her bringing it, me defending myself, me thinking its finally over and then brought up again. the last argument she agreed she wouldn't bring it up again and apologized for her behavior, but I'm wondering if this is normal? I feel like i'm not trusted and thrown accusations at, and then I'm just supposed to pretend like it never happened because she finally calmed down?

"I'll keep it as short as possible and simple. I'm 23 years old, the youngest of three siblings and autistic. The last bit matters because of it I'm not good with unexpected things or new people- and noise.

My older brother (mid 30s, the middle one) has a female coworker. I don't know her, and she is loud. Really loud. 

So last christmas he decided to bring her to our small home, and could not come out from my room (the door to my back then room is just there in the living room- as I said, its a really small house) because I was nervous of this unexpected guest- and also was in the break of a meltdown bc of the noise. Not even earbuds helped it.

So now, since I don't have him in my contacts, I asked my mom if she could ask him is he is going to bring her, so I could be prepared. She had no problems asking and knows my issues.

Well, they kept talking, and he got mad and said he can just not come, just go to the house to drop off his gifts for his sons, who are coming too. This was not my intention at all, and now feel guilty.

"I'm (24F) a wedding photographer and in May 2023 I got an inquiry about a December 2023 travel elopement. This bride is local to me and found me through her best friend. I've never met this bride prior to this inquiry, but had met her best friend once for a mini photo session.

 One day I want to eventually market myself as a travel elopement/travel wedding photographer and go all over the world for work, so I was excited when this bride reached out and I saw her venue (Out of my state) was something that was on my venue bucketlist. As soon as she booked me in May, my hotel was booked and other travel experiences were paid for in advance, and a legal contract was signed.

Skip to November 2023, I now have this bride added as a Facebook friend and I tagged her in a post promoting her small business. My best friend (24F) reached out to me asking how I knew who this girl was. She asked me like she had never spoken to me about it before. 

It's not my story to share the whole thing, but basically BFF went on to say that 2 years prior to May 2023 (before I knew BFF), this bride made her feel so low, my friend felt the need to go to a psychiatric hospital. I comforted my friend and ensured that I had no idea about this and that I was sorry about the experience she went through. I did mention I was going to be doing her wedding photos in December. I felt bad as soon as she told me about it. I felt like as a small business owner, I couldn't cancel on this bride a month before her wedding date and make her scramble to find another photographer.

Everything is fine between us from when she first disclosed this information to me to the wedding in December. She's actively texting me while I'm working the wedding asking how beautiful it is, if I'm having fun. When I was done I asked her if it was okay that I posted these photos to social media, and that I was not doing so maliciously and that I wanted her to be okay. I just wanted the location in my portfolio, and I was proud of the images. She said ""Duh, post them!"", so I did and I thought everything was okay. 

Maybe a week or so later, I'm back home and I had noticed my friend was interacting with someone that publicly embarrassed me (in front of best friend) and disrespected me. I was angry and texted her about it.

She immediately went off on me about it and said this girl didn't disrespect me and that I'm a terrible, horrible person for doing these wedding photos, and that I hurt everyone around me. She said all I care about is my money and myself, and that I didn't even consider her feelings when I did this wedding.

She's now saying that she told me about her story with my bride a year ago after I did the bride's friend's photos. She said she has screenshots and I said I had no recollection of this and asked if she would send the screenshots. She never did, and now I feel crazy? I would have never taken this booking if I knew this story?

"For context I am a 17 year old gay transgender guy, I came out to my parents two years ago. My dad(53M) has always been accepting since I started figuring out my gender and sexuality, my mom(48F) on the other hand has been more reluctant. My mom is the type of person to say they support the LGBTQ+ but will repeatedly use misgender and dead name me or my friends, whether it's in front of people or not. 

Now on to the main point, my mom and I started arguing a lot more after I came out. She misgenders me and will often ""forget"" to correct herself unless somebody else says something. We have gotten into many arguments over this, mainly when she uses my preferred pronouns (he/him) but then changes to use she/her pronouns. I have brought this up to her multiple times and I have asked her to stop, but she always says the same things like, ""it's still so new to me"", ""they're older/younger so don't make a fuss about this"", ""they're older/younger, it's hard for them to understand"", etc. I understand that for some people that it is a new or difficult topic for them to understand but when the family friend tells you ""you'll be back to ""dead name"" in a couple months"" and your mom doesn't do anything about it, kinda makes you bitter about the situation. 

I have explained to her that it makes me feel as if she doesn't truly accept me and she says that she'll try to be better in the future. And for a little while she is but then she goes right back. She has also asked me if I will go back to being a girl for guys that I like or if I apply to certain jobs and it makes me furious. She will also tell me that at certain jobs I have to be a girl if I work there. I have told her ""no, I will be staying a boy no matter what job I get or what guy I like."" This often results in more arguments and screaming matches. I have started to tell her off more now but now my dad is getting involved and says I'm being disrespectful.

My dad(53M) has always been accepting since I started figuring out my gender and sexuality, my mom(48F) on the other hand has been more reluctant. My mom is the type of person to say they support the LGBTQ+ but will repeatedly use misgender and dead name me or my friends, whether it&amp;#39;s in front of people or not. &lt;/p&gt;

"My bf is working as a marketing manager and is in charge of overseeing advertisements and social media posts for companies. His main job is to act as a middle man and communicator between his clients and web designers to ensure that the web designers under him understands his clients needs and posts everything on time for his clients. I understand his job can be stressful and demanding, especially for clients who can be quite difficult. However, the main issue now is that the web designers team under him always have issues meeting deadlines etc, even after repeated reminders from my bf. In the end, it was my bf who have to take care of the jobs the designing team have difficulties to complete and help his clients design social media posts and websites in their place. The worst thing is, he also didn’t get the credit for what he had done, and his clients all thought that the designer team is doing a good job, when by right, it was my bf who did the job for them. Sometimes, my bf would still be on his phone doing the jobs that is by right is not his responsibility during our dates. I kept advising him to try chasing the designers under him and be more firm with them and let the designers clean up their own messes if they did not manage to meet the deadlines. However, he said that he is worried if he did that, the clients would be unhappy and leave. I know I should be supportive of my bf instead of getting irritated, but the amount of work he had to do is affecting our dates etc. I guess the main worry I have is that my bf would make it a habit and in the future, if we do get married and have children, he would still be on his phone and laptop most of the time to do work instead of spending time with the family. I did try talking to him but I noticed whenever his phone start to buzz to indicate new messages etc, he will give a stressed look and I knew that he probably have the urge to check his phone for the message even when he said he won’t do any work things during that date. I feel guilty about asking this question, since a gf have to be supportive of her bf no matter what. But I really see no point in doing work that my bf won’t get the credit for and the designers should be the one to settle their own problems and not expect my bf to clean up their messes all the time.

"So in my family we have two secret Santa’s, one for the adults, and one for the kids I (F19) am in the adult secret Santa and my brother (15) saw my gift and was asking about it, I then asked him what he got for his secret Santa and he said that they didn’t have a secret Santa. They do. Every year. And names were drawn months ago giving plenty of time.

So now Christmas is tomorrow, it’s 4:30 in the afternoon in my country and next to nowhere is open and my 7 year old cousin is the only one who doesn’t have a secret Santa gift for Christmas.

My mother is now furious with him and said he doesn’t deserve gifts if he can’t give one to someone else.

My brother thinks it’s no big deal because he bought gifts for everyone else and just forgot after stressing about other gifts. 

I’m honestly not sure what side to take, because he forgot and I know he didn’t have bad intentions but I think he’s in the wrong for thinking it’s not a big deal. He asked me to post here, IHTB?

Edit: I have a small business for crochet and since I know she loves my plushies I offered he buy one off me. I know that’s kind of shitty that he has to buy something that I made last minute but I thought it was better then my cousin not having a gift. My mother wasn’t having if tho and went and found some slime from the grocery store so I guess that’s better then nothing.

"My boyfriend's roommate displays concerning behavior. I tried to surprise my boyfriend on his birthday and asked his roommate to let me into the apartment to leave his surprise. She not only agreed but suggested gifts, which I thought was super helpful and nice. Yet, upon my return with the gift, she had texted my boyfriend, ruining it. In another incident, she invited my boyfriend to an event with her and her friends, while I was standing right next to him. Now, while on a month-long international trip, she left her dog alone in the apartment without a sitter. Days later, she asked my boyfriend to care for the dog, which he has. Additionally, she sent a photo of her bikini line and poolside view to my boyfriend during her trip. When I asked about this, he dismissed it as innocent, stating while strange, there's nothing wrong with her sending a picture of her knees while poolside. My boyfriend views all these incidents as unrelated or non-issues, unlike my perspective, where I see them as indicative of a lack of boundaries between roommates and a pattern of inappropriate behavior. Am I unreasonable to ask my BF to address his roommate's behavior? 

CONTEXT: I am friends with my bf's roommate. They have two other roommates who are also women that I am friends with. My boyfriend, who isn't very close to his roommates, has been frustrated by her request to care for her dog during the holidays (his other roomies are away.) My bf told me despite giving her boyfriend a key to the apartment while she's away, she still asked my boyfriend to watch her dog. I literally have no issues with her, I've just noticed a trend that seems worth addressing. She said she had no problem letting me into the apt to give my bf his gift (I misplaced his house key) only to tell my bf I was there and ask if it's okay for her to let me in when I came back as agreed. My bf and I ran into her at a cafe when she invited him for a night out. While I think the invite is strange, she could've at least pulled him aside to ask rather than ask him in my face to hang out just the two of them.

This story starts at my lovely school in California, outside of my Geology class. I'm talking to my bestfriend and she randomly stops and pulls out her phone, she shows me a screenshot of ... lets call him ""Dominick"" (15m) saying he likes me. He realized who he was saying it to (My bestfriend) and begged her not to show me. I stared in awe, since at this time I wasn't openly gay and very closeted because of the homophobic setting at my school. I asked her ""When did he say this.."" and she said yesterday when they were talking. I didn't know what to do since I didn't reciprocate the feelings but I also was feening for a man. I pulled out my phone and texted Dominick ""Wsp"" and started a really dry conversation with him that basically felt like exchanging air quotes with a brick wall.

I was so shocked I didn't know what to say, but I just convinced myself that someone was spreading rumors and I got grapevined. But it turns out *that was not the case!* I texted Dominick after I got learned of him threatening me and he said ""I was joking lmao"". I decided to brush it off, until he said it again. This is when I decided ""how much am I going to let this little twink fw me???"" I confronted him and said ""stop joking about that shi it isn't funny.

"I (20NB) have had a strained relationship with my dad (53M) for as long as I can remember. He’s not a bad father, he’s not a deadbeat and cares about my well-being.
However, when is was around 9 my parents got divorced due to an affair my dad was having. This event has shaped me in many ways as a protector of my mother (53F) who was emotionally devastated and to have a resounding hatred for cheating behavior. Despite this I would still semi-frequently see my dad. As I age, I find myself feeling less and less comfortable being around him, not just because of the divorce, but because I am not really able to be myself around him out of fear of making him upset or disappointed with the person I am. He’s never been abusive in any way, but is a fairly traditional guy who can get pretty heated. I’m in college now and at the beginning of the semester I stopped trying to talk to him and sent a text saying that I needed space  and that, despite our differences, I still loved him, as he’s my dad. He said he understood. Now Christmas is upon us, and he has been texting and calling a lot. I have ignored these texts and calls, but do feel a bit bad, as it’s Christmas time and I don’t want to make him sad on Christmas. However, would the situation just become more awkward?

"I (f22 &amp; agnostic atheist) have been spending the last couple of days in a personal dilemma between pleasing my family (mom 55, sister 26, and dad 55) and following my own code of morals and ethics. My mother, sister, and I are all agnostic atheists. My father is Christian. My sister lives in Colorado and I only get to see her twice a year. When she’s back in town for the holidays she stays with my parents in our childhood home. I have been moved out for not even a full year and I’m expected to spend all my time with the entire family. I have already spend every single hour of PTO that I could on either visiting my sister or this holiday break. Two days ago, from the second I woke up, to midnight I spent the day chauffeuring my sister around town. Yesterday I had a migraine the ENTIRE day and genuinely couldn’t get out of bed without puking from the pain. Today I finished up a couple of last minute presents and then picked up my sister again and spend all day with her until dinner. It started off with my parents questioning my why my boyfriend (m25) didn’t want to join our family for Christmas Eve dinner (tomorrow) or Christmas Day dinner. More on that in a second…The dinner of political hell broke loose. 
It started with the typical headlines that pierced my soul. I’ve been already on a loosing battle with my mental health and have vocalized this to my parents several times that the state of the world and my current demoralizing job is really getting to my mental health. The political debate broke out and I learned exactly how my white dad justifies his racists beliefs. 
Context: My significant other is Muslim and doesn’t celebrate Christmas. He also just lost someone close in his immediate family. He’s also incredibly passionate about the World politics surrounding Gaza as he has family ties and close family friends currently suffering. 
I heard enough. I calmly stood up, washed my dishes, grabbed my coat and left my parents house. I texted my mother this is the last Christmas I will ever be celebrating as I cannot be morally and ethically okay with myself in practicing a capitalistic frenzy of “the holidays” when I’m 1) actively trying to not spend money and 2) not religious and don’t understand why we celebrate it. I can understand it’s family time. But I’ve been going over to my parents house every single day while trying to still maintain my full time job and getting backlash from both sides. I haven’t even been able to be there for my partner who is in emotional turmoil, as our work schedules never align normally and my family is taking up the hours I would typically have once a week to see him. I already bought gifts for my family and plan to drop them by the house tomorrow night after checking in on my partner to make sure he is okay and spending some time together. 
Did I overreact? I’m getting spammed with texts from my sister blaming me for ruining her time here and trying to guilt me into spending even more time with her.

My mother, sister, and I are all agnostic atheists. My father is Christian. My sister lives in Colorado and I only get to see her twice a year. When she’s back in town for the holidays she stays with my parents in our childhood home. I have been moved out for not even a full year and I’m expected to spend all my time with the entire family. I have already spend every single hour of PTO that I could on either visiting my sister or this holiday break. Two days ago, from the second I woke up, to midnight I spent the day chauffeuring my sister around town. Yesterday I had a migraine the ENTIRE day and genuinely couldn’t get out of bed without puking from the pain. Today I finished up a couple of last minute presents and then picked up my sister again and spend all day with her until dinner. It started off with my parents questioning my why my boyfriend (m25) didn’t want to join our family for Christmas Eve dinner (tomorrow) or Christmas Day dinner. More on that in a second…The dinner of political hell broke loose. 
It started with the typical headlines that pierced my soul. I’ve been already on a loosing battle with my mental health and have vocalized this to my parents several times that the state of the world and my current demoralizing job is really getting to my mental health. The political debate broke out and I learned exactly how my white dad justifies his racists beliefs. 
Context: My significant other is Muslim and doesn’t celebrate Christmas. He also just lost someone close in his immediate family. He’s also incredibly passionate about the World politics surrounding Gaza as he has family ties and close family friends currently suffering. 
I heard enough. I calmly stood up, washed my dishes, grabbed my coat and left my parents house. I texted my mother this is the last Christmas I will ever be celebrating as I cannot be morally and ethically okay with myself in practicing a capitalistic frenzy of “the holidays” when I’m 1) actively trying to not spend money and 2) not religious and don’t understand why we celebrate it.

"Would I (15) be the tah if I were to ask my brothers (12 and 18) not to call our ex-abusive father in me and my elder brother’s shared room?

For context, my father was emotionally and physically abusive before my mom and father divorced nine years ago. The girls—me and my now-ex-sister—had it worse than the boys in terms of abuse. They were still abused; don't get me wrong, but me and my ex-sister were abused more often and worse. Me and my ex-sister cut contact, but my brothers have not.

My brothers think my father has changed, but I frankly don't want anything to do with him. They call and play video games with my father regularly, which I don't mind since it's their relationship, not mine, but I'm tired of having to listen to them talk like nothing happened. It makes me feel like it's not my room or that I'm overreacting to the whole thing, but I really don't want to endure it anymore in my own comfort zone.

I want to ask them to not call my father in our room and to limit their time playing video games with him to somewhere near 2 hours.

"I(20M) have been dating this girl(22F) for almost year now. we had a happy relationship up until November when she started to be hostile towards me and whenever I ask what's wrong she just ignores or makes a misandrist comment.

This month there was a Christmas themed anime convention and my gf wanted to go badly, I was okay with the Idea and made sure to buy our all access tickets thinking it was going to be a great date idea, boy was I wrong. on the day of the event my Gf arrived before me and was waiting in a long line with one of her friends(21M), I went up to her, greeted her and asked if she ate for the morning, all of sudden she was shy and refused to make eye contact with me she answered my questions but her friend was staring me down as If I committed a crime. when I stood beside her she told me I needed to go to the back of the line because I can't cut, I listened and did exactly what she said. 

While waiting in line I can see my Gf's mood change she was laughing and talking to her friend. I was giving her the benefit of the doubt until I saw more of her friends arriving and standing with her in the line, I had a bad feeling and told my self it was best to leave so I sold my ticket and used the money to buy myself a pizza and took it home. 

about 6 hours later my gf suddenly texts me asking where I was because she is hungry and forgot her purse and the vip after party ticket home. I told her ask her friends but they only had money for themselves and their dates. I told her I was not leaving my house again for the day and she got upset with me because not only did I refuse to help her, she is not going to the after party with all her friends because of me? and I bought a pizza for myself and didn't share.

"Last week, I (m, 29) took a flight from New York JFK to London, to visit some friends working abroad. I was in the middle row of the aircraft, seated in an aisle seat. Right next to me on the right side of the plane was a cute woman, who looked the same age as me (late 20s - early 30s). We didn't interact too much throughout the flight, but I did my best to make small talk with her. She's from the UK, and she is studying abroad in America; on that flight she was headed home for the holidays. I thought we hit it off pretty well, but then I asked for her name and I started asking her if she lives close to where I was staying for my trip (I did my best to make it as non-creepy as possible). She rudely cut me off, and she bluntly told me ""I think I'll go back to listening to my songs"". I protested, and she told me to ""piss off"". Our argument was not loud, since everyone else was sleeping, but it was heated.

When we were on descent and approach into London, we got a good view of the countryside. It was very scenic, and the woman turned to me and smiled.

"(DISCLAIMER: This is a post for an ARG. This is not real. Please do not think it’s real.)

Hi, so I (26 M) grew up in a very evangelical Christian community just outside of Indianapolis. I’ve since moved away after college and I’m now a staunch atheist. While I was in high school I was friends with this girl (I’ll call her M.) M was not very popular in our community or our school. Mainly because she was too “emo” for everyone’s liking because her parents were agnostic. So she didn’t grow up with all the stupid brainwashing we had to put up with. So she got to do “sinful” things like play D&amp;D and wear tank tops in the summer. We were pretty tight back in the day because when I was at her house I got to listen to actual music and not Skillet or Toby Mac. 

She died in 2013. They found her car wrapped around a tree and her body stuffed into a garbage bag in the river. They had to have a closed casket because of how bad her body looked. There was a brief investigation but it went cold because they had no evidence. I was devastated but nobody else seemed to care. A part of me thinks some people were happy to see her gone. Especially the pastor and his daughter. (I’ll call her K).

K was the pastor’s daughter and a massive fucking bitch. She had this holier than art attitude about her and it was insufferable. She got on my nerves a lot. So I go to the wake and lo and behold there’s K. And K didn’t even like M! She’d act all nice in front of her but was super nasty behind her back. It sucked and I was already fuming. Later on I stepped out because I was overwhelmed and K followed me. She claimed it was because she thought I smoked but then she started doing her whole song and dance over how she was so upset M died, and how she was a lovely person, and that if she turned to God it would be better and blah blah blah.

Now I don’t know if it was my teenage angst or the fact I was already upset. I just blurted out “With all the lip service you’re doing, I think you might’ve killed her and just want an alibi” K started crying. Saying I was awful and ran back into the parlor in tears. Making the whole damn thing about her. Again. My parents were pissed and I became the new M until I graduated. Because I made little miss perfect cry. 

As an adult I’ve been thinking back on this for a while. I feel terrible because sure I was angry but I didn’t need to go that far.

"Me (18 M) have always had a difficult relationship with my parents. We usually don't talk much (or don't talk at all). It has been like this for as long as I can remember. They are also the typical homophobic/catholic combo, and have been insulting me and degrading me since they know I'm bisexual. Also, during the pandemic, I started demonstrating interest for cooking, and food related work/study.
I was forced by my parents to study a system engineering career, that despite it being partially interesting for me, it just isn't what I'm passionate/love doing.
After thinking about it, I decided to drop out of school and try to start working as a chef assistant (something I had already done in the past for about 7 months and it turned out great for me).
I was also told by my boyfriend's family and him that I was free to stay with them and live there if I needed to.
I felt like doing so would be the best social scenario for me, plus it would help me a lot in my personal relationships and in general being able to express myself more. So I decided to go with it.
I just told my parents about what I will do, and they got furious, insulting my boyfriend, his mother and other family members. I was also threatened by my mother, saying she could call some of her friends which are doctors and make them say I'm not mentally able to get out of their house.

"    My(22nb) baby's(9monthsm) dad(Jam, 21m) ended our relationship in October. It took me 2 months to be able to move out since I had previously been financially reliant on Jam. 
    My Baby and I now live in our own apartment, we moved on Dec 9th, and Jam and I have an agreement that says Jam can see our baby at least once a week and I must have a week's notice to ensure that Baby is available on the day Jam wants to see our baby.
     Since we moved, Jam has not asked how our baby is and has not asked to see him until last night. I got a text around 8pm asking for our baby for some of Xmas, I had already made full day plans for Baby and I because I hadn't heard from Jam with a week's notice about xmas. 
     I didn't want to be that butt that refused a man his child though, so I asked what time he wanted our baby. He responded almost an hour later with a time, and I asked if he was factoring in drive time because we live a ways apart now, and then I added a time that would work better for me. He still hasn't responded.
      If he doesn't respond by Xmas Eve at the latest, will I be the buttface for not letting him pick up our baby on Xmas?

Edit to clarify: I would love for Jam to be a parent to our baby, before he ended things I spent so much time asking him to spend time with our child, and to parent equally with me. Before my baby and I moved, i asked Jam every day if he wanted to spend time with our baby, and if he had any days off of work that he would like to be alone with our baby. He never spent more then 15 minutes a day with our baby in those 2 months before moving. He preferred to get high and play video games. 

He still hasn't responded to my messages about picking up our baby.

"So I'm a trans woman, growing up there were a lot of signs. (I would list them all but that would make it hard to explain the actual story within the word count)
A lot of the feelings stayed internal but some of them were expressed to people close to me, like my parents, enough that there was a point where my mom was worried that I was a misogynist because of some of the things I was expressing like my dislike of chivalry (turns out I didn't like it because having to participate in it forced me to be reminded I was a boy.)

She couldn't understand when I said that it just made me feel weird.

(Retroactively it turns out that it was pretty much the opposite of me being misogynistic) but my mom acts like me being trans came out of nowhere. Like it was something that suddenly happened without any warning, and then acts like I only feel this way because people on the internet pressured me to or whatever her excuse is at any given moment.

She's accepting-ish but not validating and has this habit of ignoring anything she doesn't love 100% about me and/or pushing blame of whatever on to what someone else told me to do.

When I came out as bisexual, it was also the internet telling me to be that way, when I told her I'm agnostic it was because of Goat Simulator and doing the side quests to get the “devil goat” form.

 She has a bad habit of removing my personal agency when it comes to things she doesn't like, and I'm starting to realize that the reason I have a hard time trusting my own memories is because she does that. 

In the case of my gender identity she says that all the signs I point out are things I made up retroactively, and that I didn't feel what I felt. Once again claiming that the internet told me to transition, or something like that… (as if I would suffer through the abject discomfort of my chest developing Because the Internet told me to :/ ) Anyway when I got offended at her making those claims she told me we should agree to disagree, and my response was that this wasn't something we can agree to disagree on, that she was questioning my individuality, memory, feelings and personal agency. I tried to explain to her that it's really offensive for her to try to tell me that my own experiences didn't happen, especially the ones that happened specifically inside of my own thoughts rather than being expressed outwardly. She's essentially telling me what my own thoughts were and trying to claim that she knew me better than I knew myself. We can have different perspectives I'm pretty much any other matter but when it comes to my own emotions telling me I'm wrong is kind of screwed up. Almost like gaslighting.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I (25F) recently moved into a cozy apartment in the heart of the city. Excited about this new chapter, I decided to find a roommate to share the rent and expenses. After some searching, I connected with Sarah (26F), and we hit it off during our initial meeting.

Fast forward a few months, and things started taking a turn for the worse. Sarah was a fantastic roommate in many ways—clean, responsible, and friendly. However, there was just one problem: her cat, Mr. Whiskers.

I'm not a huge fan of pets, and it turns out that Mr. Whiskers is a clingy, attention-seeking feline with a penchant for knocking things over. My favorite vase, a set of expensive candles, and even my laptop fell victim to his playful antics. I tried talking to Sarah about it, suggesting she keeps him in her room or perhaps finds a solution, but she seemed resistant to the idea.

One day, after a particularly frustrating incident involving shredded important documents, I snapped. I asked Sarah if she could find a new home for Mr. Whiskers, or at least confine him to her room. I explained my concerns and how his behavior was affecting my belongings and, to some extent, my sanity.

Sarah didn't take it well. She accused me of being heartless, claiming that Mr. Whiskers was like family to her. She argued that since I knew she had a cat when we moved in together, I shouldn't be making such demands now.

Now, I'm stuck in this awkward situation, wondering if I'm the buttface for asking Sarah to move out. On one hand, it's her cat causing the issues, and I did bring up my concerns before it reached this point. On the other hand, asking someone to part ways with their pet is a pretty big request, and I feel like I may have overstepped.

"I (30f) never had that peachy relationship with my family. Since I was a little girl, I used to be judged about my weight (I had a slightly chubbier and taller build than girls my age), was sometimes beaten with birch switches with the tiniest misbehaving, blamed when kids at school bullied me, denied of my childhood because a neighbor deemed I was too ""bloomed to play with little kids outside"" (some of said kids were even a year older than me), treated like a race horse, where the only thing that mattered was to be on top of class, even if it meant I had to study overnight almost every day since elementary school, and so on.

For 4 years now, I have been trying to keep low contact with my family.

I’m a young adult diagnosed with BPD and anxiety. To the point I couldn’t leave the house without the help of a family member for months. I finally started therapy a few weeks ago. And I started actually going to the gym alone a few times a week now. 

I was telling my mum how I go and stuff and today I saw a old classmate of mine. We never talked in school. I told my mum that I saw her and she asked the normal mum questions “did she talk to you”? I shrugged it off and said no because we never talked in school either. “Did she recognise you”? I said yes maybe. Then she asks me did she come alone? This immediately triggered me and I angrily ask her you do know it’s taking me everything to do things without your or anyone else’s help. She responds “it’s not a big deal everyone does things alone”. I hate that she assumes everyone brings a mate along to the gym when even I know that most people come alone. Her explanation was “she’s from….” They always bring people with them. Which was a lousy stereotype anyway, implying they are a large community. She should be normalising people coming alone in my opinion.

This especially shook me because I didn’t overreact or overthink in my own head about seeing this girl today and was actually feeling content with my feelings until she asked that question. My mum is otherwise quite helpful she accompanies me to my therapy appointments even if she has jobs.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-19T16:24:49.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a young adult diagnosed with BPD and anxiety.

"Here’s the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/s/2UqJ8wicWL

UPDATE:
So one of my other friends that was involved with this was still texting my (ex) friend, but then she sends me a screenshot that read, “can you tell (my name) to unblock me please? My sister brought up some good points and I think I need to reword things.” When I saw that screenshot come through, I’ll admit I was taken aback. I did NOT expect her to change her mind so quickly like that. The explanations me and our non-binary friend had weren’t good enough for her, but it was good enough from her sister??? My friend asked if it was possible for me to unblock her to talk things out. I had told her that I’ve been hurt so many times by people that would apologize shortly after, and they would hurt me again. I don’t like holding grudges, but the things she said really hurt me and the non-binary friend who I’ll call “Chloe” for the sake of the story. 

Then, my friend tells me, “She’s admitting she feels really bad how things went and how she was expressing it. She thinks she had it wrong what you were agreeing on and wants to talk to you. She talked with her sister and she helped her understand there’s a difference between gender and sex.” Then I showed Chloe what she said, and they said to me, “so it’s good enough when it comes from her sister but not us or someone who’s actually non binary?” This was my point exactly. I’m not mentally ready yet mostly because I have other things going on in life right now that are not-so-great. This whole incident with her was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I’m honestly not sure what to do with her at this point.

RECAP: Got yelled at for copying when I didn't mean to, apologized over and over and didn't have it accepted.

Okay, so I apologized again, but that didn't work. I apologized again, tried really really hard and got ""I appreciate it and I understand that you didn't mean to hurt me"" from this ex-friend.

You heard right, ex-friend. I stated there that I would leave them alone and give them some space, and went about my life like I had to. I've been depressed for the past few days, but I've tried to get on with it. And then today they blocked me. When I went to Facebook to ask what was wrong, they yelled at me for recovering too fast and being okay when I hadn't done enough to atone (even though I literally paid them $600 and apologized over and over and asked what else I could do, and abandoned a story I was proud of). Apparently I'm not allowed to talk to the group and send pics of Christmas trees to people who are not involved in the fight. And now they've dumped me as a friend and they hate me because I tried to get on with life and my depression didn't come across. What was I supposed to do??? I'm heartbroken and I keep crying. I usually never cry loudly, but tonight, I howled.

"I (20NB) and my fiancé (23F) were originally planning to spend New Year’s Eve with a close friend and his aunt who lives in our city. We are going three and a half hours out of town for Christmas to see both of our families, but we have to come back home right after Christmas due to her work schedule. She’s only been in her current job for a few months, and can’t get much time off work. I on the other hand have been with my current job for over a year, and was able to get more time. We are both going to be off on New Year’s Eve specifically, but only I will be able to get New Year’s Day off. 

Two months ago, my best friend from late middle school (20F) (who is also close to my fiancé) told us that she was engaged to her long term partner, and they wanted to get married on New Year’s Eve. The wedding was definitely planned on short notice, but New Year’s Eve is an important date for them, and they were able to secure a small venue, a dress, an officiant, and pretty much everything you’d need for a small wedding on the date. My fiancé and I were initially both asked to be bridesmaids, but the other day, when her father (who she’s never really had a good relationship with) told her he didn’t want to attend her wedding, she asked my fiancé to be a bridesmaid, and asked me to give her away in place of her father. 

She told us that she completely understands the fact that this is short notice, and she wouldn’t be upset at us if we weren’t able to make it. She also lives 9 hours away, which means that we would have to stay the night if we went, and my fiancé is not able to do that. In short, I have the ability to go, but my fiancé does not. I really wanted to spend New Year’s Eve with my fiancé for multiple reasons. Partially because of life crap, but mostly just because I love her and wanted to go into the new year physically next to her. 

That said, while I know she wouldn’t hold it against me if I couldn’t come, I also know that she’s only going to have one other person there for her, and nobody to give her away. Everyone else in attendance will be her fiancé’s family. Plus, it’s my best friends wedding, and I don’t want to miss that! Honestly, best friend isn’t even the right word for her. The fact that she asked me to give her away should tell you something. I wasn’t surprised at all when she asked because that’s the type of relationship we’ve always had. She’s my family. She’s the little sister I never had (despite the lack of age gap). I don’t want to miss her wedding.

My fiancé is actively telling me to go. She says it wouldn’t be right for me to miss it when I am physically able to get there, especially after asking me to give her away. But straight up, I just feel bad about leaving my fiancé here. I don’t wanna do that. I know she won’t be alone, but I feel really guilty about not spending that time with my fiancé. Is my fiancé right? Should I stop feeling guilty and just go? Or would I be a buttface for going without her, despite what she said?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-19T04:42:42.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (20NB) and my fiancé (23F) were originally planning to spend New Year’s Eve with a close friend and his aunt who lives in our city.

"Me and my partner were planning on staying in a hotel together on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. I was really excited until he mentioned knocking on everyone’s doors at midnight. I explained to him that doing that will get us both kicked out and is inconsiderate to other guests, to which he said that since he paid for the room he can do what he wants. He also said that if I don’t like what he’s going to do then I could just stay home instead.

Frankly, I find what he said extremely immature. He’d rather go around disturbing people than have me at the hotel with him. His mam and stepdad even said that what he’ll do is a terrible idea, but he thinks he’s in the right and I’m just being controlling/trying to tell him what he can and can’t do.

Millie and I never became friends again after the second falling out over Jaden. She is still in our group but me and her do not speak to each other at all. You’d think it’s awkward but it’s actually not as we did this for 3 years over another silly fight a few years ago.

A week after Millie tried taking Jaden away from me she started talking to one of Jadens best friends which i thought was not a coincidence. We will call him Peter. Peter is a well known player and uses girls, Millie knew this before talking to him. Basically it went on for 3 months with no progress at all, he never actually liked her because the whole time he was going over to other girls houses. I do feel bad for her but she knew what she was getting herself into.

But me on the other hand, I am in a happy healthy relationship with Jaden now. We are the perfect match and couldn’t be more happy i chose him over her. She did say to our friends she wants to forget the whole situation and wants me to hear her out but there’s nothing to hear her out on imo. She was wrong and she knows that now. I gave her to many second chances and i’m done.

"So my ex and I had a gradual separation due to his lies and infidelity. We haven't been romantically involved for over two years but because we had a kid, we took it slow to separate our lives. We've both been dating other people and are moving on and untangling our lives now.

When we were together his immediate family would come over for breakfast on Christmas morning and then we'd meet his extended family at his aunt's house for dinner. Last Christmas was the first time we were living separately. I still hosted his family for breakfast but didn't join them for dinner. I exchanged gifts with everyone that came to my house for breakfast.

This year, things have gotten more serious with my boyfriend. Also, there has been some distance with my ex's family. Which seems natural and I'm okay with that. My boyfriend's family asked when the best time to have their Christmas celebration so my daughter and I can join. I contacted my ex to coordinate with his plans. He asked that I still hosted Christmas breakfast for his family. I wasn't thrilled but said yes. 

I was a little stressed about money because now I'm buying gifts for my family, my boyfriend's family AND my ex's family. It's just a lot. But I still contacted my ex SIL and asked her what her children would like for Christmas. She said she'd get back to me so I haven't bought their gifts yet.

My ex also didn't know what time his aunt's dinner was and I needed to know this to coordinate my daughter's schedule. So I asked his mom. When I talked to her she informed me that SHE was hosting Christmas breakfast. Great! I'm off the hook! Weeks go by and I never hear back from exSIL what her children want. I'm never invited nor asked what I wanted for Christmas. So I assumed this was us all going our separate ways. 

Then yesterday I had my (ex) nieces over for a sleepover with my daughter. My exSIL informs me that there's confusion on Xmas breakfast. My exMIL says she's hosting but my ex is telling everyone I am. I clear that up but then my exSIL tells me what her kids want for Xmas and apologizes for not getting back with me sooner. 

So now I feel awkward. I know I did ask. But then after finding out I wasn't going to be seeing them on Xmas, I thought we all dropped it. What's the best way for me to not be the buttface? My exSIL also has two step children that I never saw even before the split. Before I always treated them equally and bought equal gifts. But my exSIL didn't even mention them when telling me what her children wanted. Do I still buy gifts for everyone that I bought gifts for when I was with my ex? Do I only buy for the children? Only the two children that I still see or all four? I did invite the two nieces over to decorate cookies on Xmas Eve, I could potentially give them gifts then.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not hosting nor attending my ex's Christmas breakfast. I thought I was hosting for a short while until I talked to his mom and found out she was. If I was hosting or attending I would bring everyone gifts. And since I thought I was hosting I asked my exSIL what her daughters wanted. Which caused the awkward situation once I found out that I wasn't hosting.

I've decided I'll still give the girls gifts at least this year. I don't know if I'll continue to do so for the years to come. I'll probably feel obligated to since this year I set the expectation. Plus my daughter is close to these girls so I expect they will stay a part of my life. I'm not going to get anyone else from my ex's family gifts.

"Using a throwaway account for privacy.

Recently my girlfriend of about 5 years has brought up the topic of marriage with me. For context, we have been dating since we were sophomores in high school, and we are both currently attending the same college (we are juniors right now). We plan to live together after we graduate.

I told her I wasn't sure if I wanted to get married, and that I would prefer that we just dated. She asked why, and I told her that it would make our lives easier and less stressful, especially since we wouldn't have to worry about divorcing. She said that she understood but I could tell from the look on her face that she was upset even though she was composed.

So, just to share some background: my parents divorced when I was younger and I watched them fight multiple times during the process, to the point where they screaming in each other's faces. Even though they had joint custody, I grew up raised by my mom and my dad was mostly absent from my life other than paying for child support and occasionally having Zoom calls with him. My mom was probably the only the parent that I really had in my life and the divorce has certainly affected both of us mentally for a long time. I don't want to get into it too much.

I think it is safe to say that me and my girlfriend are inseparable and we both love each other very much. We have the same values and goals, but it turns out that marriage isn't one of them. I am afraid that if we marry, something will happen later down the road that will result in a divorce. I mean, my parents met in grad school and were together for several years and never saw it coming - and look what happened. Having kids definitely made it harder for everyone involved. Granted, my girlfriend and I do not want to have kids so I guess that would make things easier if we ever married and divorced, but still.

This is just an example, but Hugo Weaving (the actor who played Agent Smith in The Matrix) has been dating his partner since 1984 - that's almost 40 years. And to this day they haven't married. So I can see it being possible for us to go the same route. I feel like our life would be easier if we just stayed boyfriend and girlfriend and didn't marry. I would rather break up than divorce, should it ever come to that (but I hope it never does).

I know I will have to have this conversation with her again, but I don't want her to hate me for not being interested in marrying her. Am I the buttface for feeling this way, or do I have every right to not be interested in marriage?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-17T19:34:52.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a throwaway account for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

However it's 430in the afternoon, she still has not mentioned what time I'm coming to get her today, last we talked she said to call her at 630 since she was waiting for her daughter to get home from work.

If I leave at 7 I'll be back home around 9-930 which would give me just enough time to do my bed routine.

", I (21M) recently found myself in a heated debate during a class discussion about the Israel-Palestine conflict, and I'm wondering if I might be the jerk in this situation.

So, our professor opened up a discussion about the historical roots of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and things were getting pretty intense. I have a strong interest in history, and I've read quite a bit about the subject. However, during the discussion, a girl (20F) confidently stated that the conflict started on October 7. I was taken aback because I was pretty sure that wasn't accurate, and I spoke up to correct her.

Now, I don't think there's anything wrong with correcting misinformation, but maybe I could have done it in a better way. I said something like, ""Actually, I believe you might be mistaken. The Israel-Palestine conflict has deep historical roots that go back much further than October 7."" I tried to provide some context and mentioned significant events from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

She didn't take it well at all. Instead of engaging in a thoughtful discussion, she got defensive and accused me of being condescending. In response, I might have let my frustration get the better of me, and I mentioned that she seemed uneducated on the topic.

"So long story short I worked at a wonderful company where I feel most of my coworkers were good people. I’m struggling to understand how someone was seriously so upset by this that I had to be let go. 

First of all, I am black. I have black children and a black partner. I love everyone from the bottom of my heart. I never said anything rude about anyone of any race. 

I was overheard outside of work referring to my close friend as a n*gga. It was not aggressive. There was nothing negative. It’s just a word we use to refer to each other like “dude” or “man”. Most black people I know use the word causally.

Anyway someone went to work and told hr I’d said the n-word and then every single person at work stopped talking to me and I was fired immediately. While I recognize it’s taboo in some places and I wouldn’t say it at work just like I wouldn’t say a swear word, I am truly struggling to understand how a white person could actually think I meant it in a racist way when I am black!

While I recognize it’s taboo in some places and I wouldn’t say it at work just like I wouldn’t say a swear word, I am truly struggling to understand how a white person could actually think I meant it in a racist way when I am black! They actually treated me as if I was a racist which was surreal. No one had a single kind word for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I the buttface here? Am I out of touch?&lt;/p&gt;

"Sorry in advance for the long post. Had to shorten for mod rules:

I (22 F) had a friend, let's call her Tabitha (27 F) for the sake of the post. She has a TikTok and goes live sometimes, but she got banned recently and she texted me about it. I asked her why she got banned, and she said, ""I don't understand why people use they/them pronouns"", and she was saying some not-so-nice things about them. I told her I understood why she would get banned because it would look prejudiced to non-binary people. I also told her that she probably shouldn't have said that on a Live. She claimed that she got banned for a week or so because she said, and I quote, ""I'm not able to speak my mind"". She claimed to be an LGBTQ+ ally, but I told her that I questioned her allyship now because of what she said. One of her replies to me after that was, ""Well if people can decide what they want to be called or believe so can I?"". I told her that it sounded like she was making excuses to not support non-binary people. Then I told her, ""It's disrespectful to not use the pronouns someone prefers to use. You know how it's rude to call your teacher by their first name? It's just like that. There's no need to make it harder than it has to be."" This is where the conversation takes an extremely negative turn.

She then said, ""Why do I have to accept it? It's like being straight is bad now lol. Why can't people understand both sides?"" Then I said, ""If your opinion is whether or not people should exist, that's not an opinion; that's oppression. That's wrong on every level. That's part of their identity. Why are you so against someone's identity? That's disgusting."" She replied, ""I don't understand what the disgusting part is in this whole problem just because I don't agree with it and it doesn't make sense to me all of a sudden it's disgusting."" And she goes, ""Oh wow so it's not a free country I see. I can't have my own opinion and you can?"" I told her, ""You're missing the f\*cking point. People's pronouns are NOT debatable. They didn't choose to be non-binary. No one does. Not understanding is fine. But saying that you don't agree with it is wrong."" I also told her that it's not like having an opinion on a movie, a favorite color, a food, or anything simple like that.

She continues to say, ""So basically I'm not free to have an opinion because I stayed in my opinion, and clearly, that was wrong"". Then I blew up on her. I texted our mutual friend who is non-binary about the whole situation, and they were really upset. I told them that I was looking out for them and their friendship with her, and they were questioning this friend's allyship like I was. I had talked to another mutual friend about her behavior too. I then blocked this girl's number and all of her social media accounts I follow or am friends with. So, Reddit, AITBF?

For the most part B and J get along fairly well, occasionally they do fight as most brothers and sisters do. J however has started becoming very mean to her brother. She's really bad about hitting him. Last night I was in the middle of making them dinner when I heard both kids screaming at each other, a few seconds later I heard big bang then a blood curdling scream from B. I dropped everything I was doing and ran to where the kids were where I saw B on the floor crying and screaming. In I asked what happened dad tells me that J pushed B into her dresser. I asked J why, It turns out B had taken one of her toys out of her room and got glue all over it. I then told J to sit in her room and play for a bit and I would talk to her once I got B calmed down. Thankfully B wasn't hurt too badly. Just some bruising on his head and a scratch on his side. I sat him down gave him some ice for his head and told him to let mommy know if he starts to feel funny. Then I stepped back into the kitchen to calm myself and finish making dinner. One of my biggest triggers is my kids hurting each other. 


After everyone had a chance to calm down. I brought B and J into the living room to have a talk. I asked B why he thought it was ok to take his sisters toy, He claims he wanted to make it pretty for her. 

I then told him that from now on he is to stay out of sister's room while she is at school, that that is her private space and unless she gives him permission he is not to touch her things, I asked if he understood he said yes, 

Then I talked to J. I told J that it is never okay to put her hands on her brother even if she's upset. I told her that if B is bothering her then she needs to use her words and tell B to stop and if he doesn't to come get me. I then told B that if sissy is communicating to him that she doesn't like something he is doing and is asking nicely for him to stop he needs to respect her and do so. Same goes vice versa. I asked them both if they understood and they both said yes and apologized to each other for their part without even me prompting it, gave each other a hug and went off to do their own thing.

"I (23nb) have a friend (23nb as well) who's had a fling with a 22 year old female for a bit, I think a year before I met him. They were never really together as a couple because the girl didn't want to be  but never really specify it to my friend, which resulted in him hurting very badly. I ended up meeting with since all of us three attend the same school.

My friend and I are really good friends and  he told me that story maybe a year after we really met. He's now in relationship with a really cool girl and recovered, and I wish them the best.

A few weeks ago  I was at a party with my friend's ex fling. We were a bit drunk but I wouldn't blame anything on the alcohol. She attracted me very much and we got pretty close. One thing lead to another and we ended up spending the night together. I didn't think about my friend at the time. I called him the next morning to confess what happened, ready to face the consequences. 

He first told me that he's fling with that girl was over a long time ago and  that he wouldn't want to stand between me and that girl. But he later came back to me saying he thought about and ended up with the conclusion that I did not make a good move, which I totally agree with. He told me he still wouldn't want to interfere, but he wouldnot want to be witness us being close since it would mean him hurting. I told him I completely understand and that I would stop the thing, which I did (nothing ever really started to be honest). 

But now I'm in a weird situation. There's still an attraction between me and this girl and we feel it everytime we speak to eachother, but lever act on it, and ln the other hand, my friend came back to me again with the former ""I don't want to interfere, it's okay for you to do whatever"" speech.

"# 2 years ago 

Our son was born in 2021, during the height of the pandemic. We were both vaccinated. Days before my wife was due I caught a respiratory disease, which caused some coughing. She caught the disease too. COVID-test was negative at the time. Thanks to a cough that was too hard, her water broke, so our son was born two days prior to the planned C-section. C-section was necessary either way because our baby was in a breech position.

The procedure went well, he was born healthy &lt;3

However, days later she fell during showering in the hospital, this may have ruptured the suture. A couple of days later she was released from the hospital. At home both of us developed a fever. Now the COVID-test was positive for her, not for me somehow. She had heavy abdominal pain too, so the ambulance brought her back to the hospital, but now to the COVID-department instead of the maternity ward (standard procedure, nobody knew/cared that she recently had a surgery).

Here she caught enterococcus through her wound, and also her condition refused to improve after the antibiotic treatment. It turned out that she developed a hematoma. It took 6 weeks of treatment for her to recover - she missed the first 6 weeks of our sons life. Lot of misery :(

# Today

We started working on our second child a couple of months ago, so far nothing. In the recent weeks many people have fallen ill in my proximity. A couple of days ago I caught a flu-like something again - COVID-test negative again. She has been constantly nagging me that please don't infect, don't do this. I don't wanna, obviously, my mom-in-law also explained to her, that it doesn't work that way. 

I kept a mask on, kept distance, regular hand washes etc. To no avail, she caught it too.

"AITB for not wanting to follow my wife's move?

My wife (43F) and I (49M) have been together for 20+ years. We have 2 teenagers. I'm an academic, and she moved with me twice - the first time for a full-time job, and the second for a tenure track job.

These moves were definitely ""for me"", but there were some perks for her, as she was able to finish, tuition free, her bachelor's degree, and then a specialised degree in a healthcare profession.

A few years back, the programme I was teaching in was cut, and all of the professors in it were sacked. She found a job in her new field close to a big city. It was my turn to move with/for her. I have started to work freelance from home and have been doing well.

Now my wife has been offered a new job in a small-ish town 2 hours away from our hometown (more than 1000 km from here). She says she thinks the conditions will be better there, and that she would like to be closer to our parents and extended family. She also says that since I work from home, it shouldn't be a problem.

However, I am not so keen on going to live in a small town where I know no-one, and having all of us have to start over for the second time in a few years. (It's ""close"" to home, but it's not home.) I also have more job / business opportunities here.

Sometimes, I think ""family comes first"" and decide I'll go to the new, small town and help the family start over. I'll make the best of it, I think.

Some other times, I think ""well, we hade a good run, and she is now able to succeed on her own. Maybe now, it's time to part ways and each follow our paths. But I'm affraid of how this would complicate things for the kids. (I think they might prefer to stay with me? But how would that affect my wife?)

&lt;p&gt;My wife (43F) and I (49M) have been together for 20+ years. We have 2 teenagers. I&amp;#39;m an academic, and she moved with me twice - the first time for a full-time job, and the second for a tenure track job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These moves were definitely &amp;quot;for me&amp;quot;, but there were some perks for her, as she was able to finish, tuition free, her bachelor&amp;#39;s degree, and then a specialised degree in a healthcare profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years back, the programme I was teaching in was cut, and all of the professors in it were sacked. She found a job in her new field close to a big city. It was my turn to move with/for her. I have started to work freelance from home and have been doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my wife has been offered a new job in a small-ish town 2 hours away from our hometown (more than 1000 km from here). She says she thinks the conditions will be better there, and that she would like to be closer to our parents and extended family. She also says that since I work from home, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

" this story happened senior year, I have already been friends with max before having feelings for him, I was close with max and sara (my best friend) but they were not close with each other mostly because they were very different from each other.

after a year of our friendship, I told her that I was in love with max

surprisingly she told me she investigates for me to see if he has any feelings for anyone, I didn't really think about it cause girls do that for their best friends.

however, I also told one of our mutual friends the same thing and hi said he will look into it too

after about like a month sara starts to talk to max more but awkwardly, like they are always fighting

I found out from that other friend came and told me that max is in love with another girl and he doesn’t know who.

after like three months I really moved on, one time while I was talking to max, I mentioned that I used to have feelings for him and I joked about it

one day I was hanging out with a friend and we meet another girl that I didn’t really know except that she is classmate with sara and she told us “Did you see what happened between sara and max “I was confused and I asked her what is she talking about?

she said that max has confess to sara that he loved her 3 months ago and that she rejected him but told all her classmates that he did but in a shitty way and all the fighting that has been going one is because of that matter

at first, I didn’t believe her because I knew sara would have told me and if the classmates knew that means our mutual friends (we in the same school) knew also so they would have told me so it’s impossible for me to not know

I asked “that other friend “if it was true that this happened, he confirmed it and told me that we have been keeping it a secret cause we didn’t want to break your heart

I got angry because I felt played on, I didn’t care that max loved sara I only cared that they didn’t fucking tell me and everyone knows and to add that I always was the one to fix things between them when they fight but as it turned out to be lying about the reasons

I first confronted max and he apologised that he lied to me and kept thing from me and we went back as friends.

but when I wanted to talk to sara she ignored me and never answered my calls nor my text, when I stopped to talk to her, she wouldn’t, even after all of this I did find a way to talk to her with help from other friends so I asked her why she has been ignoring me?

she told me that because she knew I will play the victim and over dramatic about this and what she did is nothing wrong and she doesn’t understand why I found a problem because she was just protecting my feelings, I didn’t know what to do so I left crying and tried forget about this because I still wanted her as my bff .

and I did find out that she has been telling “her classmates” that she rejected my crush and I made a big deal out it

so i deleted her from life completly

" 

I work in retail and as you all know it's the busy season. So it was insane... And I was by myself serving, trying to get through as many customers as humanly possible.

At one point, I had these two regulars, a married couple.

I usually serve them once every six months or so. But I remember them distinctly because the wife is always very flirty...

Anyway, I served them yesterday and she began asking me If was going to be with family for Christmas. And since I was in a rush and had a bunch of other customers staring at me, I just kind of flippantly told her that my family was over on the West Coast, but I always make it a habit to try and fly over around January...

And I guess I gave her the impression that I wouldn't have anywhere to be on Christmas. Because she then insisted that I come to theirs for Christmas.

And that's incredibly generous of these people. But before I could say anything, she doubled down. *''I'm dead serious by the way. I want you to come to ours for Christmas.''*

With all of these other customers waiting to be served, she had kind of caught me off guard, and I didn't just want to dismiss her with an *''Uh... Actually, haha, I have somewhere to be after all... Haha!''*

So I just kind of looked at all the customers and then back at her trying to think of a diplomatic out that wouldn't seem fake or insincere.

She noticed me looking at the customers and realized I was busy, so she demanded I give her some paper and a pen and that she would write down their number so I could contact them if I decided that I wanted to go.

I started serving the other customers and she discreetly slipped over the paper to me. Which has her contact number and says *''For Christmas lunch. No gifts. JUST COME''*

Half an hour later when it was more relaxed she and her husband returned. And she approached me once again and said *''I'm dead serious by the way. We want you to come! There's no need to be embarrassed. We're down some seats this year and I'm THIS close to going out and inviting some homeless people over!!''*

They seem like genuine people. And she seems to really want me to come (which makes me feel a little bad). But I do have my own Christmas to be at. And her house is also a little out of the way for me to even just drop by just to say merry Christmas.

With all this considered: WIBTB for not going?

"Last night I had just finished my shift at Walmart and sat by the bus stop.

There was a girl on one side and two guys on the other smoking. I just tried to sit as far away as possible to avoid the smoke. But I sat down quietly and started scrolling through my phone.

At some point, I heard an aggressive *''Oi cunt''* which I paid no attention to and kept my head down and hoped for the best.

*''Oi cunt, I'm talkin' tah you don't ignore me!!!!''*

My brain: Are they talking to me?...

*''OI, WALLMART, I'M FUCKIN' TALKIN' TAH YOU ALRIGHT?!? DON'T IGNORE ME YAH SHIT-FACED CUNT''*

Then the second guy he was with started speaking...

*''YEAH, WALLMART, STOP IGNORING HIM YA CUNT''*

At that moment I knew they were talking to me and looked up at them... But it felt extremely demeaning and like they were mocking me. 

*''WHAT'S THE TIME, WALLMART?''...*

*''WALLMART, THE FUCKING TIME YA' DOG CUNT''*

Apparently, they wanted to know the time (and I had my phone out). But I was like if this is how these people speak to others when they want a favor then fuck 'em. So I just put my head back down and ignored them.

Because of this the first one got up and came over to me, got right up in my personal space, raised his fists at me, and began threatening to knock me out if I didn't tell him the time.

At this point, he's puffing his chest out and getting all in my face.

And that's when the girl intervened and told them to leave me alone and fuck off.

*''WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING HIM?!?!''*

Girl: Because you're both assholes! He's clearly just finished work and you're harassing him.

*''NO HE'S A CUNT AYYYY I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THE FUCKING TIME AND THA FUCKING CUNT WOULDN'T TELL ME AYYYY''*

AITB?...

People are telling me I'm a jerk for not answering these guys. And that I should have just told them the time. But I feel like if you're going to be rude you shouldn't be surprised when people don't want to interact with you...

"A few months ago, I finally cut off my ex after five painful years of friendships/relationships with him. It was insanely toxic between the two of us, and we both have wronged each other, but I know for sure he has wronged me in more significant ways. I won't go into details, but just know he was an awful partner and treated me like I was a nobody, having weeks and months of no contact during our relationship.

Basically, a little over a year ago, he had gotten with somebody in our friend group. Normally, this wouldn't sting as much, but he apparently had immediately had sex with him and told me very quickly. We had broken up about three months prior, so it was a very fresh wound for me. He also would brag about constantly having sex, and even would have sex while my friends were in the room. He gave way too many details to me as his ex, and everything hurt every time I was around him and his boyfriend. During our relationship, he also refused to call me pet names or kiss me properly (more like a peck or whatever) and wouldn't allow me to call him pet names. However, with his new boyfriend, they would kiss in front of me and call each other sweet names, which made this all sting even more.

I finally got fed up and decided enough was enough and called everything off--no contact whatsoever for the rest of our lives. It took nearly five hours and throughout it, he stated that he was also a victim in our relationship and that I had done the exact same things he did to me, which has caused me to spiral in my mental state.

I (F28) have this friend, NB26, who's a writer. They're currently sending their work to publishers through their agent. I've been nothing but supportive of this work from the start. It's important to note that I am a proofreader and they have hired me.

A few days ago, they, out of nowhere, started accusing me of plagarizing their work. It seemed to stem from a comment where I'd joked about being inspired by them in something I was writing involving an engagement ring. It actually had been mostly inspired by other fanfics in the same fandom where a ring would appear back on the owner's finger after she tried to take it off. I got defensive and said that I was hurt. They answered that I lacked empathy and didn't understand. I sent them the story just to prove I wasn't copying them.

Now they're saying that I plagiarized their story and have to take it down immediately, even though I never put it up in the first place. It will never see the light of day. I want to make it clear that I did NOT plagiarize their story. It didn't occur to me until they said that it had too many similarities. I apologized over and over after deleting it (on Word).

Apparently that's not enough because then they said I was making everything about me even though I didn't say anything else other than I mishandled a situation and want to fix it and that I'm ruining everything in our friend group. I had a meltdown, didn't answer the message and tried to give them space. I then started writing an apology letter which I intended to deliver in a few days. Apparently that wasn't enough either because they sent me another nasty email before I had a chance.

Now they're saying I haven't admitted to plagiarizing their story so I've ruined their trust in me as a friend and proofreader and I'm seriously worried they're going to report me. Then they said all the messages I was sending were aggressive and hurtful. That's a fair point, but hers were even more aggressive and hurtful. They also said they can't trust anything I say because I'm probably lying, which really upsets me as I am autistic and have trouble lying about anything. I just sent the apology I'd already written and offered to pay back the money they paid me for proofreading. They refused to reply and another friend had to tell me that they said they don't want the money back. I don't think it's fair as I wasn't trying to steal anything and they're making like I did it on purpose just to hurt them after knowing me for fourteen years and I'd never do anything like that. I had another meltdown where I cried for over an hour. I'm scared they won't ever be friends with me again and they're friends with all my friends so it'll ruin our group. I can't vent to anyone because my parents are fed up and I can't talk to my friends.

And I'm not going to say I maliciously reworked her story into mine because I didn't.

"Today I(22F) was having a depressive episode where I was feeling sad about my future in university and family members who can never seem to give me a break about my weight and other things. My BF(20M) has developed something like a sixth sense into knowing whenever I'm depressed, he texted me asking if I'm okay and I told him the same old story that everything is getting to me, he tried to cheer me up with words of encouragement and motivation but like always it never seems to make me feel better. he had to go to work. 

While BF was at work my friends texted me and I told them the same thing I told my BF that everything is getting to me and my friends told me that life will get better and that I should keep my head held up high. their words seemed to have moved me and I did in fact feel a little better. I made a bad move and screenshotted their text's and posted it to my WhatsApp status with the captions ""Thanks guys&lt;3"", ""Feel so much better now"" 

I was going to delete it after a while but my bf saw it while he was at work, he texted me explain this is what he was trying to tell me earlier and asked how just because my friends said it makes a difference. I told him I was sorry , I originally wanted to use his messages for the status but my friends would complain I am showing off my bf and also the fact any advice from him would just be bad. he started to have a meltdown asking me a whole bunch of questions like why does everyone including me his gf, always think he is the worst at everything, why does nobody have faith or believe in him, why does everyone think he is stupid no matter how many times he proves himself etc etc(Tbh it's the way he behaves and acts people said he may be a ND but don't know for sure, we also don't know what ND means). after his questions and I gave my answers that maybe he is just too different and weird he stopped texting and didn't message me until he got home suddenly in a better mood pretending like nothing happened earlier.

"I (23F) am an EMT. Last week my paramedic partner and I plus three other crews responded to a quadruple murder-s\*\*\*\*\*e. Guy killed his family, then himself, with a knife and an AR-15. No survivors. It was horrific.

To its credit, our company stepped up. All of us who responded to the scene were invited to an official debrief session and upper management flew in crisis counselors and therapy dogs to help us work through the trauma.

The debrief session just ended. It was great and helpful except for one thing: one of the responders brought their 5-year-old child ""Alex"". I'm not a fan of kids but I don't have a problem with them if they're unobtrusive. But this kid was a menace the ENTIRE TIME. Alex would crawl under the table, talk loudly, yank on the therapy dogs' harnesses, run all around the room, etc. At one point, my coworker was trying to discuss a serious topic, and Alex interrupted no less than four times to point out the presence of a doggy. Alex's parent would occasionally give an ineffective ""shush"" but otherwise just smiled like Alex was being adorable.

I know some kids may have social issues that cause them to act rambunctiously, and that's fine. But if you know your kid is like that, don't bring them to an emotionally complicated meeting like this. Also, we were cursing like sailors, and talking about feeling brain matter squish under our feet. Not exactly kid-appropriate topics.

I want to email the supervisor who coordinated this and ask that children be disallowed from future debriefs. I was too distracted by Alex's behavior to get as much out of the session as I could have. These debriefs are supposed to be safe, DISTRACTION-FREE spaces for us to process our trauma.

I think I might be TB because I seemed to be the only one bothered by the kid's behavior. Everyone else either ignored Alex or thought it was cute. Like I said, I don't like kids, so maybe that's making me too sensitive. I also might be overreacting by asking for all kids in general to be banned based off of one irritating one.

"My boyfriend \[30M\] and I \[28F\] were asked by his mother to host Christmas Eve dinner for his parents and brother. Hoping to share the expenses, I requested he contribute half of the grocery costs, amounting to $261, with a specific ask of $100. However, he cited financial strain, listing recent expenses like our anniversary dinner ($250), my dad's visit ($358), a breakfast we had ($26), my birthday dinner ($300), and Christmas gifts ($900). He claimed spending over $4,000 on me, but I have the totals from my Christmas list, and he didn't come close to that.

When my dad visited, my boyfriend declined his offer to pay. He also suggested a pricey 7-course meal for my birthday ($150 per person), but we ended up doing something else – a food fair in the city where he bought me a $30 ring and snacks. I regularly treat him to breakfast, gifts, and dinners without complaints.

His mom later expressed regret about us hosting, but I felt obligated since they usually host and initially asked me to do it. Despite similar incomes, I cover most bills, including $400 for electric, $1,000 for groceries, and my personal expenses. He pays $280 for internet and $360 for HOA, with his parents covering the rest of his bills.

"i (26f) am in my home country on vacation with my family. we visited my grandparents who are religious. they converted to this religion when i was very young, but not too young that i didn’t have memories of them before they converted.

i left my home country when i was 15. i don’t remember exactly how old i was when they converted, but i remember my grandfather trying to *influence* me into converting, telling me all the “teachings” about their religion. about 80% of our conversations throughout my childhood since they converted have been about this.

i was a child, so i didn’t really have the power to set boundaries. i’ve also realized that he was really only like this to *me*, and didn’t talk about religion or try to influence my cousins and sister into converting, at least not as hard as he did with me.

yesterday, we visited them at their home for my grandmother’s birthday lunch. when i sat down to eat, my grandfather immediately told me he had a present for me - a book, bc he knew i loved to read. i didn’t get my hopes up - i knew it was going to be a copy of the “holy text” for their religion. after we finished the meal, my grandfather brought it out and proceeded to tell me about it, salesman style, and i tried hard not to roll my eyes. 

i just couldn’t understand why we couldn’t have a normal conversation, why he hasn’t made any effort in getting to know me as a person other than i loved reading. idk why most of our conversations my whole life have been about religion. it was also very frustrating that he singles me out every time, that i’m the only one of his grandchildren he tries to influence like this.

at the end he said something along the lines of, “so… will you accept this book?” in front of my family and i just couldn’t take it anymore. i said “no. i don’t want to” and got up from the table and sat in their living room. after years and years of being forced to listen to him talk about their religion to me and trying to convert me, it felt like such a relief to finally say no. as i walked away, he said “you don’t understand! this isn’t meant to convert you!”

thankfully, we didn’t stay long after that, maybe half an hour. however, after we left, my mom said “you should’ve just accepted the book” very disappointedly, and shortly after, i found out she took the book anyway.

in my defense, it’s not like i blew up at my grandfather and made a scene. i calmly told him no and walked away. but my parents have implied that i might’ve hurt my grandfather’s feelings by rejecting his “present” and that i should’ve just accepted it and moved on. i know they have a point but in any other context, it just seems so strange to single someone out and talk to them about your religion so much, and then pressuring them to accept an unwanted present in front of their family. am i the buttface?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-15T11:59:03.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i (26f) am in my home country on vacation with my family. we visited my grandparents who are religious. they converted to this religion when i was very young, but not too young that i didn’t have memories of them before they converted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in my defense, it’s not like i blew up at my grandfather and made a scene. i calmly told him no and walked away. but my parents have implied that i might’ve hurt my grandfather’s feelings by rejecting his “present” and that i should’ve just accepted it and moved on. i know they have a point but in any other context, it just seems so strange to single someone out and talk to them about your religion so much, and then pressuring them to accept an unwanted present in front of their family. am i the buttface?&lt;/p&gt;

"AITBF for moving out without telling my parents Update 2

Talked to my grandparents today and they said I could move in with them later this month! They said I could stay in the basement for the time being. 

I will talk to my parents soon and tell them I'm moving out and if it doesn't go well I will have the ""Go bag"" ready in my car and I will just go. If they take my car I have options! My grandparents are very willing to drive me around! Also I could buy a car off FB market place or my chruch said they are willing to help. 

I grew up thinking that the way I was raised was normal. I'm just not realizing that it's not. I'm okay for right now physically but mentally... I'm fucked. I hope this move will help.

"i (26f) am in my home country on vacation with my family. we visited my grandparents are religious. they converted to this religion when i was very young, but not too young that i didn’t have memories of them before they converted.

i left my home country when i was 15. i don’t remember exactly how old i was when they converted, but i remember my grandfather trying to *influence* me into converting, telling me all the “teachings” about their religion. about 80% of our conversations throughout my childhood since they converted have been about this.

i was a child, so i didn’t really have the power to set boundaries. i’ve also realized that he was really only like this to *me*, and didn’t talk about religion or try to influence my cousins and sister into converting, at least not as hard as he did with me.

yesterday, we visited them at their home for my grandmother’s birthday lunch. when i sat down to eat, my grandfather immediately told me he had a present for me - a book, bc he knew i loved to read. i didn’t get my hopes up - i knew it was going to be a copy of the “holy text” for their religion. after we finished the meal, my grandfather brought it out and proceeded to tell me about it, salesman style, and i tried hard not to roll my eyes. 

i just couldn’t understand why we couldn’t have a normal conversation, why he hasn’t made any effort in getting to know me as a person other than i loved reading. idk why most of our conversations my whole life have been about religion. it was also very frustrating that he singles me out every time, that i’m the only one of his grandchildren he tries to influence like this.

at the end he said something along the lines of, “so… will you accept this book?” in front of my family and i just couldn’t take it anymore. i said “no. i don’t want to” and got up from the table and sat in their living room. after years and years of being forced to listen to him talk about their religion to me and trying to convert me, it felt like such a relief to finally say no. as i walked away, he said “you don’t understand! this isn’t meant to convert you!”

thankfully, we didn’t stay long after that, maybe half an hour. however, after we left, my mom said “you should’ve just accepted the book” very disappointedly, and shortly after, i found out she took the book anyway.

"Several years ago I kissed my best friend's crush and I still feel bad about it even though it happened when I was young. I, (13F at the time) had a huge crush on my best friend for about a year (13F) who I'll call Annie. My other best friend, (12F) who'll be Ella also had a crush on her, and told me about it near the end of the school year. At first I didn't admit to liking Annie in that way, but eventually I told Ella that and we both decided neither of us would make a move because we were all extremely close and didn't want to ruin anything between the three of us. Even though we decided this, Ella continued to tell me that we should go to Annie and confess at the same time and she could choose which one of us she liked. I disagreed to this as I felt it would be awkward and make the situation more about Ella and I then about telling Annie our feelings. I was also sure that it was very likely Annie wouldn't return feelings for either of us, and we would both get rejected. Eventually, I told Ella that she could confess to Annie if she really wanted to, but to leave me out of it because I wasn't comfortable with telling her about my feelings. 

Fast forward about a week later when the three of us are having lunch. Annie was sitting in between the two of us, and she kissed my cheek. I was used to this because my friend group would do that often so I went to kiss her cheek back, but Annie turned her head at the last second so we kissed on the lips. I kind of froze after pulling away, but she kissed me on the lips several more times. The period ended right after that and Ella had disappeared. I looked for her around the school but couldn't find her as I wanted to let her know I was sorry for what happened but I couldn't find her. I thought about texting or calling her, but I was too much of a coward and I wanted to talk in person so she could get that I truly was sorry. 

Over the summer a mutual friend of mine and Ella's messaged me with screenshots saying that I was a ""back-stabbing bitch"" who ""really fucked her over"" she also said she hated amid other, more hurtful things I don't feel like mentioning. I found out through Mutual Friend that Ella had told Annie about her feelings but Annie rejected her and Ella blames me for that. The entire summer I was aware of all of the things Ella said and continued to say about me to one of my friends. At that point I didn't contact her because like I said before, I'm a coward, and also the fact that Ella had said hurtful things to/about me before. It's been years and Ella still tells people at our high school that I'm a snake even though I did eventually apologize to her and tell her I panicked during the situation and I wasn't the one who initiated the kiss. I get why Ella was upset, but I feel the way she handled it was immature (I know we were young at the time but she still holds onto what happened in the 7th grade even though she has a boyfriend now).

I live with my grandmother and ma, And today i had a outburst of rage while playing a game and punched a pillow, My grandmother who was at home saw me punch the pillow and started ranting about how i was cargo to the family and how i should be the one to die first in the family since i don't have a job or anything, and to keep my anger in check and how she's had enough of me entirely.

"AITB for thinking my cousin was dead after being missing for over a year? I (F23) live in a small rural town.  My cousin (M51) vanished suddenly one day, and was not seen or heard from for some time.  This town is small. Everyone knows each other. It is extremely rare that people leave town, let alone travel significant distances.  People here prefer to stay at home, as is sensible. Outside of our peaceful country village is a dangerous world with all kinds of monsters and other dangers.

My cousin (We'll call him Bill) is unmarried.  He has no children. His part of the family have always been strange.   His neighbor claims that the day before his disappearance he had 13 strange looking  foreigners and a suspicious old man at his house for a dinner party.    The next day Bill was seen running down the street screaming about an adventure.  Then months  go by without any word of him.  Enough time passed and it was assumed he was dead.  Bill has never left home for a long period of time before. He's a homebody who prefers to smoke and read books.

As is the local custom, when someone dies without any heirs, the local government auctions off their belongings, if they don't have a will (he did'nt).  Bill shows up the day of the auction apparently having come into a lot of money. (More money than anyone here has ever seen). I'm not sure what he did to get that money 

 From what it sounds like, he was involved in some sort of criminal activity while he was away, working for some foreigner.  Either he's insane or fell in with a bad group of people doing who only knows what. Either way his decision making ability is suspect. 

Now he won't talk to me, and he blames me for having to buy back his stuff. Our relationship was rocky beforehand because how strange his family always has been and he lies to people claiming I stole his spoons.   Someone had the nerve to suggest that I'm somehow in the wrong. I don't see how i could be wrong, he left in an unusual and uncharacteristic manner and was missing with no news of his safety?

"I was born with hip dysplasia. The orthopedic doctor my parents saw at the time suggested to them to use ""double diapering"" as an alternative method to using a hip dysplasia brace. He also noted a femoral anteversion in my right leg (my femur goes inward a bit instead of straight) and said it would straighten itself out as I got older. Spoilers: neither of these methods worked. I developed a femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in my right hip along with bone spurs. After some time, I no longer saw an orthopedic Dr growing up and I was never told anything about my hip and what I should be aware of.

As a result of this doctor's poor medical advice, I developed really bad hip pain, lower back pain, leg pain and I had to stop working my physically demanding job. I am now on short term disability while I look for a re-assignment to a desk job. I'm very sad about losing my job because I loved what I do. (I'm a public servant).  
I'm also waiting on a MRI contrast + follow up with an Orthopedic Hip Surgeon to have my hip fixed. 

All of this could've been avoided if my parents brought a proper hip dysplasia brace when I was a baby. 

Would I be the butt face to ask them to buy an adult brace for me along with paying for some of my hip surgery if the surgeon says I need it? My out of pocket max is $4,000 and I can cover some of it - not all.

"Okay, I know this sounds weird. But let me preface this by saying that ITS NOT IN A WEIRD WAY. Let me explain. My brother (M19) and I (F19) are half siblings and only 10 days apart in age. He is my best friend and I am his. We are incredibly similar and he has been an anchor for me through a lot of abuse I went through, including sexual abuse, and when he went through something similar, I was there. We have deep discussions about everything, including the effects our r*pists had on the way we view sex. Sex is normalized for us because of what we went through, so its never been a taboo topic. Another great thing, my best friend other than him happens to be his girlfriend! I've always loved our dynamic because its never felt like third wheeling because im so close to both of them. One day, me and my bestie were discussing how my friend joked that maybe I'd be able to masturbate if I got the viral rose toy (I've never been able to do it, likely due to trauma). Well, my brother joked maybe I wouldn't have been such a whore in high school if I could masturbate (THIS IS OKAY, WE JOKE ABOUT THESE THINGS A LOT). This is when my best friend got visibly uncomfortable, and asked me if I could not discuss masturbation with 'her boyfriend'. I was so confused and so was my brother, considering the three of us have had discussions about my sex life and their sex life (never in depth, we're not THAT comfortable). I felt so bad for making her feel uncomfortable, and I apologized, but she was very cold to me the rest of the day. She told me the next day that I was 'so weird' for talking about that with him, and I brought up the fact that she has told me explicit things theyve done together and about his anatomy despite me not wanting to hear it and being very weirded out. She told me she's joking when she does that and that I'm a bitch for not just respecting her wishes.

 AITBF for moving out without telling my parents 


Update~ SO my boyfriend and I sat down and had multiple conversations about this and we decided we would talk to my grandparents about me moving in. I hinted to it during Thanksgiving but on Saturday I called my sister and told her some of the things the happen in this house and her reaction said alot. She lives with my grandparents and talked to them for me. (She is my biological fathers daughter) She later called me and told me that they Said that they would have to talk to me and that the soonest I could move in is the end of December or early January. I talked to my boyfriend and together we made a ""Go Bag"" and a ""GO Bag list"" listing everything I'll needed to leave if I needed to leave quickly. Once I'm out I will worry about how to get my siblings out. For now I need to worry about me and my safety, then I can help them out. I'll update yall as soon as I can!


Next update is out

"(I made a similar post yesterday and took a lot away from that in terms of the need to regulate my self hate, but I felt it didn't represent my true feelings or concerns.  Hoping this can clear that up.)

A former friend of mine recently told me they couldn't be my friend anymore.  I'm so resentful and annoyed at them.

Firstly, I hated how they treated me.  They would only talk about themself and never take an interest in me at all unless I was acknowledging the things going on in their life.  They would make fun of me in front of our friend group relentlessly and never say anything positive about me unless we were in private.  They would ignore me when the conversation wouldn't be about them when texting.  Like we'd spend a decent time texting about the stuff in their life then as soon as I told him something about my life like ""hey I heard this new song today that was really banging"" or ""I had a super wholesome moment at work today"" he would just never reply again until days later when he'd send something about himself to talk about.

Secondly, he got super annoyed at my self hatred and tried to make it seem like a bigger burden on him.  I wouldn't say self hatred stuff around him, I would sometimes make a tweet or something like ""I hate myself today"" and he would text me that I'm being selfish and bringing down the mood of everyone.  I can sympathize with that, I've come to learn that negativity in front of loved ones can be very hurtful for them and I should strive to be stronger for them.  What pissed me off is how friend wouldn't check in with me at all.  He could have just said nothing too, I don't do it for check ins I wanted to express my feelings but to text me that I'm being a jerk when I'm already so low and then say how this is ruining his day and life, that he can't bear to see me in this place when he doesn't do anything supportive.  Not gonna lie it makes me very angry and resentful towards him.  He also minimizes my trauma saying things like ""you're so lucky you have x y and z, you should be happy"" ""people have real problems and you're upset about strict parents"" (my parents have abused me).

So when he came to me and said he didn't want to be my friend anymore and that I'm a bad person, I couldn't even care or empathize with him.  Besides not wanting to be around a self hating person, I understand that and it's an area I need to improve in.  But I don't feel like a major jerk here.  Should I?

My husband was reluctant to this idea since he belives I'm not reado to drive on my own, I explain to him if he keeps being there while I drive i wont be able to face the difficulties i may find while drivin  
Keep in mind we own a Toyota Corolla 2006 (manual), the difficulties am having is sometimes the car turns off while trying to get out of a stop on an uphill street, I eventually get out of there driving, but my husband yelling at me while it happens makes it even harder to resolve.  
Today he basically forced me to drive back home from the shopping mall, saying I would be alone tomorrow at work and I had to prove that I was going to be alright, I refuse since I wasnt feeling ok, I was tired, I helped my mom shopping for christmas dinner at the store, helped my mother inlaw buy clothes for the kids all while he was sitting on the car waiting (disclamer i agree to this since he did a night shif the night before), I gave in and drove home, I felt prerssured and he kept critizing my driving which made me even more nervous and made more mistakes, I ended up parking and giving him the keys while he yell at me: ""Im telling you right now you are cancelling your shifts for this week because you are not ready to do this"", I felt so embarresed, my mom and the kids were sitting in the back, I just handed him the keys told him to finish the ride home (we were about a minute away)

"throwaway account since my friend uses reddit

for some background I was my (25nb) friend's (27m) plus one at a wedding. He was a groomsmen for his childhood friend and didn't want to go alone since he didn't know most of the other guests or the bride and her family very well. I've met his friend in the past and we've gotten along great so he had no problem with my being a plus one and after meeting the bride for dinner and at social events a few times she okayed it too.

everything about the wedding was beautiful however the reception didn't go as planned, it was meant to be outdoors and it started raining. luckily the venue had a small indoor area and everyone worked to quickly move things inside. the building was small though meant more for bathrooms and prep spaces than hosting 250 people. 

The major thing that this impacted was dancing. We were able to create a small space for the first dance and mother son and father daughter dance but for the rest of the guests we were out of luck really. I was really looking forward to dancing since I only ever went to one school dance and this was the first wedding I've been to since like the age of 10. My friend knew this and at one point dragged me outside to dance. A lot of other guests followed us and started dancing too. Bride and groom however didn't join in at the time I didn't really think much of it I assumed it was because she didnt want to ruin her dress and he wanted to stay with her.

A few days after my friend got a nasty text from the bride claiming we upstaged her and ruined her day by taking the attention away from her. She was also upset that we and other guests got to dance more than her at her own wedding. I understand she's upset about things not going as planned but I'm conflicted since she could have joined in and it really wasn't something we did to upstage her or anything we just did it to dance plus we weren't the only guests who did. My friend is also upset since his friend hasn't texted him back in a week. Are we the ones in the wrong?

"So this story starts a year ago. So I (19f. 18f at the story) and my ex roommate ""Abby"" (19f at story) were roommates. We had 6 people per dorm, the only other relevant person is ""Kennedy"" (19f). 

So Abby and I shared a room. I'm more introverted and Abby is very extroverted and loved to talk about everything and anything. I don't mind that. I'm listener to some people and a talker for others. Abby has a tendency to ramble for a while, basically having a conversation with herself. And she wanted to talk all the time. She knew I was an introvert and wanted to talk to me 24/7 because we were roommates. I wouldn't have minded talking a lot but if it made sense I wasn't clicking with her friend wise. I felt like we were just acquaintances the entire time. I think she saw me as her de facto best friend since we were roommates. i hope this explains our relationship and why some stuff she said or did made me uncomfortable. She would also call her mom most days for an hour.

On the very first say I met her she told me how her bio dad was abusive to her mother. She said they broke up when her mom was pregnant with her. All I know other than that is he was ab//ive and she has never met him before. Again, this was the first day I met her. This was in response to me asking about her stepfather adopting her.

So, I'm grey aroace. I don't feel comfortable talking about sexual stuff unless A) it's to vent or B) I'm super close with you and I mean SUPER close.Abby told me she reads it in public because she can't pull any guys. She also asked me for a ride to a guys house so they could hook up (why not ask the guy to pick you up?) There were definitely more sexual things she talked about to me and the other roommates who didn'f feel comfortable listening. She even at one point mentioned how she did it with her ex boyfriend in public. It made everyone feel uncomfortable.

I think the last thing i need to mention is how Abby treated Kennedy. So, within the first week, Kennedy thought Abby put plastic in the microwave. It was a complete misunderstanding on Kennedy's part from what I know, but Abby kept escalating the argument. I do remember Kennedy apologizing and not really being mean during any of it (or at least doing her best not to be). Abby got mad and held a grudge on Kennedy for months. She called everyone in the dorms abusive mentally and emotionally to people outside the dorms, told people Kennedy was a narcissist and bipolar, and during group therapy (our dorms have that option incase needed) read a very hostile letter targeting Kennedy. I don't remember what all was written but she claimed she wrote it all herself and wouldn't elaborate on anything she wrote. She either said ""My mom wrote that"" or ""I don't know"" when we asked what a part it meant. She then said her mom helped her and wrote some parts and then admitted her mom wrote the entire thing.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-18T21:11:45.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this story starts a year ago. So I (19f. 18f at the story) and my ex roommate &amp;quot;Abby&amp;quot; (19f at story) were roommates. We had 6 people per dorm, the only other relevant person is &amp;quot;Kennedy&amp;quot; (19f). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Abby and I shared a room. I&amp;#39;m more introverted and Abby is very extroverted and loved to talk about everything and anything. I don&amp;#39;t mind that. I&amp;#39;m listener to some people and a talker for others. Abby has a tendency to ramble for a while, basically having a conversation with herself. And she wanted to talk all the time. She knew I was an introvert and wanted to talk to me 24/7 because we were roommates. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have minded talking a lot but if it made sense I wasn&amp;#39;t clicking with her friend wise. I felt like we were just acquaintances the entire time.

 I (42f) have been with my husband Luke (48m) for 13 years and we have a blended family. We love and treat all the kids equally while respecting them as individuals.

 His son David (19) hasn't had a job in over a year. We've tried to be understanding, but we're struggling to pay his bills plus a loan we took out to pay back someone he stole from in order to keep him out of jail, which we now regret because he obviously didn't learn anything. I've lost all trust because he is an addict in denial and continues to take others' belongings and lie about it. My relationships with the other kids are better but they seem to go to my husband more unless they want something from me, and I don't know why.

  Luke says he agrees with how I feel but seems to have accepted the way things are, or at least doesn't want to make waves. He doesn't stick up for me anymore or even compliment me like he used to. He listens but doesn't offer any reassurance. Our sex life is non-existent, like it's been only a few times in 3+ years. I've tried talking about it but he always had a reason that I couldn't fault him for: headache, back pain, tired. The only times I internally questioned it were when he'd say he was too tired but stay up for hours gaming before going to bed. I even asked without judgment if it could be a sex drive issue like low testosterone, but he dismissed it. I brought it up one last time yesterday and he admitted he has no desire but insisted it's not anything to do with me.

  I don't want to give up, but I'm feeling like my relationships are one-sided, and I don't know how to keep going on like this. I know everyone is dealing with their own issues and my depression and anxiety don't help matters, but I've been trying. I want to improve things but they just seem to stay stagnant no matter what I do. Thanks for reading and I'm open to any advice and questions to clarify if needed.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-12T05:52:56.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (42f) have been with my husband Luke (48m) for 13 years and we have a blended family.

"We 'co-work' from home as roomies as we all work remotely. 

I had my laptop closed (I just got in from working out of a cafe for a change of pace), and was responding to work messages on my phone. 

RoommateA was sitting, headphones on, and silently typing, we didn't acknowledge each other - and this is normal for us - it's a work mode or focus zone. We live together and will just say hi afterward when we both have bandwidth.   


RoommateB was taking a meeting in their room and came out. I was in the middle of typing something that was taking my full attention. I didn't have headphones on, and was doing it on my phone - so they threw out a 'Hey, how's it going'. Understandable - our usual ""leave me alone"" cues were not in place. I responded, 'One sec'. Immediately I could tell they were off-put by this. But I finished what I had too. Then, turned my full attention to them and said ""Hey, sorry was just in the middle of finishing a message for work, what's up - how's it going"".   


RoommateB said: 'I was just asking how you were doing' and their tone was a bit annoyed. I replied, ""Ya, sorry I was just in the middle of typing and didn't want to lose my train of thought.

"(TW Abuse?) I'm a 19-year-old girl with high-functioning autism, planning to move out of my parents' house within the next month. I've decided not to inform them until the day I leave. This choice is influenced by a history of physical punishments, neglect, and mistreatment, including disturbing incidents with my stepfather during middle school. My parents have consistently prioritized house chores and grades over my well-being, affecting my extracurricular activities. This has been continuous even to this day. Recently I was involved in a minor car accident where no one was injured. Me and the other party exchanged info and I was on my way. It wasn't until later in the week that I found out that my parents didn't inform me that they didn't add me to the insurance. My car was insured but my name wasn't on it. So in short my parents got doxed which led to a huge argument. I asked them ""why didn't you guys tell me I wasn't on the insurance?"" And ""why didn't we talk about this before I started driving"" which they followed with ""this is just common knowledge, we didn't need to have this convo"" and ""if the police got involved you could've got arrested "" after the argument my step dad decided to handle the matter physically by punching me in the gut and pulling my hair and my mom is now charging me 360 a month for her insurance. My parents also have 3 other kids (all younger then me) that I take care of and that I love with my whole heart and soul. I would hate to leave them and they are honestly the only reason I've stayed this long. What happens to me doesn't happen to them but I'm just scared that if I leave it will start to. So AITBF for moving out?

"I’m a little divided on how I feel. I (23f) don’t really want to go to Christmas with my mom(44f) anymore. Our relationship has always been complicated but this weekend was a lot of shots thrown by her.

  This weekend we went to my grandmothers house to celebrate early Christmas with her since she lives far away. We were all having a nice conversation, and talking about me and my work (I work with dogs) they were talking about all the great things I could do with that and I told them I’m just not passionate about all the things they were talking about. I’m very passionate about where I am and what I do with dogs.

   My grandmother told me, “passion doesn’t pay the bills” (this wasn’t a dig, she was laughing and joking around, my grandmother is a very hard working and amazing lady) and my mom shouted in front of everyone that I don’t have to worry about bills since I’m a dependapotamus/dependa (implies the military spouse sits at home all day doing nothing while their service member sacrifices everything to keep them comfortable) I found that very offensive. I am in no way, shape, or form a dependa. I work 65-70 hour weeks, 12-15 hour days. Yes my fiancé pays the house bills but I help with everything else and I am saving for our wedding. I work 2 jobs at the moment and I am working my butt off.

My mom is the kind of person that tells me one thing then says another when we are in a crowd. I felt so stabbed in the back, offended, hurt. But then again they are constantly telling me how sensitive I am. So I don’t know if I’m just being sensitive or have the right to be hurt. 
I know this is something stupid to be mad over but for me it was the mail in the coffin after everything else she did this week. (Will explain what else she did in comments if anyone wants to know) 

I also want to state my fiancé is completely on my side and was not there at the time of this conversation and that’s why he didn’t say something or stick up for me, I just told him about it today (2 days later)

"I feel like I would be the butt face if I do this so I probably won't. It makes logical sense to be but I'm probably being selfish.

So backstory - I (33/f) hate to be a stereotype but I suck at driving and anything to do with cars. I have extreme anxiety when behind the wheel. At the worst, if I have to drive on a busy highway or an unfamiliar place I start shaking and I feel darkness going around my vision where I'm afraid I'll pass out. I push through. I'm okay if I drive familiar areas. I usually try to avoid driving anytime I can. I will often ask others to drive me somewhere if I can't get out of going. I work from home. My daughter rides the school bus. I do whatever I can to not go on the road. And when I do, I research easy routes. It doesn't help that I am severely directionally challenged, to the point that I suspect there could be a medical reason to it. Like I even get lost in buildings. 

I left my husband over two years ago due to infidelity and lying on his behalf. We never officially divorced because it was more hinderance than help. He's supported me the entire time and I still have a lot financial things tied up with him. We're now both seeing other people. I'm moving in with my BF next month and my ex has been living with his new gf for several months now. He's ready to finally divorce and untangle our lives. One of the things is that my car is in his name and he pays for the car insurance. 

My car is getting old and has several fixable things wrong with it. I'm not sure how to go about fixing those things and am not sure if I feel like putting the money into it. Plus I'm not sure if it's worth paying the car insurance. Once I live with my BF, I'll probably rarely ever need to drive. Most things my BF will being going with me and he doesn't mind driving. On the occasional DR appt or whatever, I can use my BF's car because he also works from home. He's already told me I can use his car instead of mine because his car doesn't have any issues and it has back up cameras and blind spot detectors. 

I feel like if I keep my car, I'll be paying car insurance for a car that we'll only occasionally drive not out of necessity but just because we can't let the car sit untouched. But then what if there is an off chance that my BF and I need to be at different places at the same time? Plus this is putting all responsibility of driving on my BF and I don't feel like that's fair. I often get a lot of disapproval when I tell people I don't like driving and that I'm not good at it. No one understands my struggles. It makes me feel like I'm being a baby about it and should just drive and get over my fears. 

Would I be the butt face if I just sell my car? Or honestly I would be okay just giving it to my ex since it's in his name but I don't think he wants it. I just don't want to own a car anymore.

Edit: I should clarify that I'm aware that I need my ex to turn the title over to sell it. I'm not trying to sell the car from under him. When we split we decided which vehicle would go to who. And the titles were mismatched. We just never got around to fixing it because there was no need to. I wasn't asking if I was the BF because of my ex being the title holder. I was asking because I would not have my own vehicle and would be relying on borrowing my boyfriend's.

It makes logical sense to be but I&amp;#39;m probably being selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So backstory - I (33/f) hate to be a stereotype but I suck at driving and anything to do with cars. I have extreme anxiety when behind the wheel. At the worst, if I have to drive on a busy highway or an unfamiliar place I start shaking and I feel darkness going around my vision where I&amp;#39;m afraid I&amp;#39;ll pass out. I push through.

"I (37f) have been married to my husband (56m) for four years. I knew he had some issues when we got married but it wasn’t until about a year into the marriage that I realized how bad it was. He has extreme OCD with dermatillomania. 

I have tried in every way I can think of to get him to get help. I have made doctor appointments and he will just not go or if he does he will make a different reason for why he is there. I have had more talks with him than I can count, it’s almost daily at this point and he just ignores me, is dismissive, or pacifies me. If he was actually trying to get help, this dilemma would not exist. 

I cannot live my life like this. He can’t go five minutes without picking at this skin, he has open sores all over. His hands are always covered in blood and he gets blood on everything. There are bloody fingerprints everywhere, on all the light switches, medicine cabinet, doors, EVERYWHERE. All of his clothes have blood stains and his pillows have stains. My five year old is even starting to get grossed out and doesn’t want dad around his toys. 

That’s not even the worse. My son will be eating a finger food and my husband will come and stick his hand in and grab himself some. He sticks his bloody hands in shared chip bags, shared cereal boxes, he will even reach in frozen French fry/ chicken nugget with bloody hands. 

I reached the end of my rope and told him next time I make dinner, I am going to make sure to bleed in his food. He seems to think it’s okay for us to eat stuff he touched with his bloody hands, he should be okay with me doing the same to him. Maybe going to this extreme will finally get through to him because if I don’t get through to him soon, he’s going to lose his family.

Update:

My son is not my husband’s son, but he has been around since he was 12 weeks old and is the only dad my son knows. 

I have made a doctor appointment for my husband and am taking off work and escorting him there and going back with him. I have also gotten in touch with his EAP at his work and they offer free mental health services and marriage counseling. This is my last effort. The fact that I actually considered messing with his food tells me a lot about how much this is affecting my mental health.

"So I (19M) have been battling a severe heart disease my whole life. Just found out a few months ago my heart is failing and have been in the hospital ever since. Not giving out hospital name for personal reasons. 

I just met a guy a few days ago named Marcus who ended up being my roommate. He had a brain tumor and was around my age. He was telling me his story and why he was once again back in the hospital there was one part of his story that just really didn't sit right with me. He said he had been seeing the doctors giving the patients next door to him the wrong medication and he said that he was probably given the wrong medication. 

Now ik sometimes brain tumors can mess with peoples minds and this guy was not in good shape so I wanted to think that that's all that was and the doctors weren't actually giving patients the wrong medication. But a few days later he ended up passing away unexpectedly in his sleep. I watched sadly as the doctors were wheeling his body out of the room and a few minutes later I began to really think about what he said about being given the wrong medication. I started asking myself what if he was right and that's what killed him? 

Not wanting to take chances of that happening to me I decided I wanted to leave as I no longer felt safe. I was somehow able to get my clothes on sneak past a group of doctors and get down to the lobby where I booked it out the front door got in my car and went home where my gf was very surprised to see me. Seeing how bad i was shaking she sat me down and asked me what I was doing home. 

After telling her the story she got angry with me and told me that I need to go back to the hospital and that I do not look well enough to be home. I told her I'm not risking getting the wrong medication and it killing me.

" 

(28M) recently found myself in a situation that left me feeling frustrated and upset, and I'm wondering if I'm the jerk here or if I did the right thing by standing up for what I believe in.

So, I have this friend, let's call her Amy (28F), and we've known each other for a few years. Everything was going fine until I started noticing Amy's ableist attitude towards autistic people. I myself am not autistic, but I have friends who are, and it's important to me that they are treated with respect and understanding.

Amy has made several insensitive comments about autistic individuals, using derogatory language and making fun of certain behaviors. For example she said all autistic men are creepy , and all autistic people are violent. I tried to brush it off initially, thinking maybe she wasn't aware of the impact of her words. However, as time went on, it became clear that this was a pattern of behavior.

Last week, we were hanging out with a group of friends when Amy made yet another insensitive remark about autism. I couldn't take it anymore, so I decided to call her out on it. I calmly explained that her comments were hurtful and perpetuated harmful stereotypes about autistic people.

Well, Amy did not take it well. She got defensive, insisting that she was just joking and that I was being too sensitive. I tried to explain that it's important to be mindful of our words and how they can affect others, especially marginalized groups. Instead of understanding, Amy accused me of overreacting and ruining the mood.

Now, some of our mutual friends are siding with Amy, saying I should have just let it go and that I'm making a big deal out of nothing. Others agree with me, recognizing the need to speak up against ableism.

So, Reddit, AITB

"This summer while  having dinner in a neighbor restaurant in my city, me(16) my mom(42) and my stepdad(37) were having a lovely night.

(We are fine after the story)

FLASHBACK:

Still in the same summer but in the start of it, I accidentally outed myself to my mom, and this happened by me accidentally posting a reel to my intagram story, but if you use instagram you know that there is a setting that makes easier for you to post on facebook and in instagram in the same time, I had enabled that function but for some reason it had abled again. That specific reel was about bisexual people or whatever.
When my mom saw it on facebook she was confronting me about it, althoght I tried to avoid it I had to tell her, she was extremelly sad, but she told me that she is just conserned about my safety because she knows how dangerous people are in this earth, especially to people like me(LG'B'TQ+ people). Long story short she kinda accepted me but still in denial till this day.


That night my stepdad was giving me some mixed signes on wanting me to tell him something, I had the impression that he already knew it, he has always been that toxic masculin man that thinks about the man and the women as completely different things and that things should be the same as they where tought by his mom and dad, or by the older generation in general, althoght he has some of the most toxic masculine trades or fragile masculinity, he is a nice guy.
In days prior I was feeling him trying to get something out of me, one day we were at the beach and there was a gay couple that was there, they were very descrete and my stepdad said,""you see, you can be gay but you dont need to be like those feminine crazy ones"", I was shocked. He has always shown and said how much he hates gays, and now he was saying that?
Wierd.

Now after we finished our meal he started to talk about transgender people and them 'stealing cis womens place in sports' I started getting extremelly upset and I told him everything I knew about it, and he was like,""Oh so how do u know all that stuff"".
My mom was quiet trought the whole thing.
He kept asking if I had something to say to him and at one point I kept looking at my mom for help, she got so mad at my stepdad and say,""for Crist Sake just tell him directely"".

After I told him the story began to unfold.
My mom had told him mounths ago like a couple mouths befour this, thats why he was acting wierd.

After that he was screaming, not letting me speak, looking like he was the one in the right here.
He literraly telling me, why dont you trust me, why did you keep this away from me? are you scared of me?

YES FREAKING HELL I AM.

He is the type of stepdad that would care more about every move I made then he would care about his freaking kid peeing his pants because he was too busy playing videogames, he was so anoying, nothing ever was perfect, he is a narcisistic dude that thinks he is always right, ofc I would be scared.

After knowing that my mom did it I dont trust her anymore.

My mom had told him mounths ago like a couple mouths befour this, thats why he was acting wierd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that he was screaming, not letting me speak, looking like he was the one in the right here.
He literraly telling me, why dont you trust me, why did you keep this away from me? are you scared of me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YES FREAKING HELL I AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is the type of stepdad that would care more about every move I made then he would care about his freaking kid peeing his pants because he was too busy playing videogames, he was so anoying, nothing ever was perfect, he is a narcisistic dude that thinks he is always right, ofc I would be scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After knowing that my mom did it I dont trust her anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

"TW for slight violence, I guess.

From the ages of 12-14, I, (15F) dated ""Ollie"" (15M). We broke up after nearly two years because we weren't good for each other, and we figured we were better off as friends. We fought all the time, both had individual/family issues and overall it was a very juvenile relationship that never would've worked out.

The day after we broke up, Ollie came out to me as gay (identifies as a guy and only wanted to date guys). I'm queer, so I had no issue with this; I was just happy I could be his friend and see him live his truth. Around 2 months after we broke up, Ollie started dating ""Ian"" (16M).

One day, Ollie, Ian, myself, my partner, my best friend ""Carla"", and Carla's ex, were all at Carla's house. My partner, myself, Ollie, and Ian were in the kitchen eating, while Carla and her now-ex were in the other room.

I made a joke, and Ollie responded by hitting me (he is a very touchy and slightly unaware person). He hit me much harder than intended, and I told him that it hurt. He felt bad, and said, ""Hit me back."" I had no desire to hit him, but he insisted. As a compromise, I just kinda put my hand on his face and like... squeezed it..? That's the best way I can describe what I did. Well, regardless, Ian did not like this. When I grabbed Ollie's face, Ian took a step towards me, grabbing my wrist and bending it back until I had to push him away. I had a plate of food in my other hand so I had to try to kick him off of me, and after about 5-10 seconds, he let go.

When I got home, I had a conversation with Ollie, telling him that I felt hurt and disrespected because he considered me one of his best friends but didn't try to help or defend me. He said he ""didn't see it happen"" (even though he was right next to me when his partner did it) and that he would encourage Ian to ""talk to his therapist."" 

At the same time, Ian was texting me, saying that he ""had the intention"" of causing me pain/scaring me... Yeah, he said that. He explained that he wanted to hurt me to ""teach me a lesson"" and that he wasn't sorry for doing it. I expected an apology at some point, but it never came.

That event was over a year ago. After a month of waiting for them to apologize, I cut both Ollie and Ian out of my life completely. Fast-forward to about two months ago, and Ollie told my bestie, Carla, ""I don't know why what Ian did still matters to you."" In the past year, Ollie has made excuses for Ian. 

He went on to say that I was the a-hole, implying that I deserved what Ian did to me. He has spread lies and talked behind my back, telling people that I ""talk shit"" about him. All I've ever done is explain the facts of why we are no longer friends because, for a while, a lot of people kept asking me what broke up our close friendship. I feel like maybe I am the buttface because honestly, a lot of people turned on me and took Ollie's word on the situation. It's just a very messy situation that has taken up a lot of my time for nearly a year and a half.

"So basically, I (16M) am kind of developing a dislike to this girl in my class. She's quite popular, good looking and a bit shy but confident and energetic when you get to know her.

Almost everyone likes her, but for some reason I don't. So she's pretty friendly with everyone in my class and she's nice to me too but for some reason I feel a sense of discomfort.

We were in the same group together for a project and my best mate even got her to help me with a Math equation. But in both occasions I felt uncomfortable. Extremely uncomfortable.

She's quite sophisticated and dresses like a typical outgoing girl you'd see on Instagram and often spends time playing video games during break with the other girls. She looks like a model and has a lot of followers. The guys like her too, but more of a classmate than a romantic interest. I'm probably the only guy who gets suspicious of her while everyone thinks she's kind.

She would film TikToks with my best mates in class and it would, for some reason, make me uncomfortable. So I ended up confiding to one of my classmates and she agreed that she's also quite uncomfortable with this girl.

My classmate feels like she's walking on eggshells whenever she's around because she gets a scary aura from her. She also gets a feeling that the girl doesn't like her. Here are some instances:

•She would roll her eyes whenever she tries to talk

•I overheard the said girl laughing at her with her friends

•She would get intense glares from her sometimes

There was a time where our teacher brought her in front of the class and asked us if we could give her compliments, after she got a lot, she was asked how it felt, and she replied that she doubted the legitimacy of their compliments. And idk why but I got arrogant vibes from her.

And the thing is, everyone likes her. She acts like a nice person to everyone. Including to me. But I have to keep up a positive face all the time so everytime she talks to me I have to act like I'm interested and comfortable. Unfortunately, it's the opposite.

But my other friends have agreed that she's quite unapproachable. But the thing is, it's just that I feel suspicious that she's looking down on me.

It's not that I hate her, since hate is a strong word. I kind of dislike and I find her unapproachable and uncomfortable to be in the same room with. And she is just the last person I would want to talk to or be friends with in my class. I feel like I horrible person for disliking her.

"This story takes place when we just graduated college and the details are changed for privacy.

 Me and my friend were film students in college and we worked on A LOT of stuff together so our resumes and work were nearly identical. Not all the way of course.

For example: If there was a really good film that we made, it would be myself credited as the writer and they would be credited as the director, then in another good film it would be them directing something that I wrote. Anyway...

The point is we were very very close collaborators. My friend found a really cool job so being a good friend I helped them apply by making an entire website for them because they liked how I was able to make my own portfolio/website free online. However, once I made the website they said, “Okay, now you must ***promise me*** you won’t apply to the same job.”

A week later and still unemployed I was thinking, you know what. I have a resume I have a website. I have skills. I deserve to apply to this job just as much as they do. Why don’t I just submit my own resume and website and see what happens.

They got the interview, I did not. Truth be told I was jealous, but I never said a word. 

I woke up that morning to a very angry phone call. They were really angry that I broke my trust and applied to the same job they did, because at the interview the employer apparently said something along the lines, I noticed another person made similar work, why? They had to explain that *we worked togethe*r and that he did not “steal” my work. They said I made them look dumb.

Long story short I cried they hung up and we have never been friends since.

"I (36f) am a retired escort, been out of the business about two years now, just personally outgrew it but have no regrets. I met my fiance (43m) 3 years ago (no he wasn't a client, but he knew from day one what I did for work and he was completely supportive,  and wouldn't have minded me continuing I just personally outgrew it). I now own some franchises (with the $$ I made from being an escort). 

Anyway I live in the US where it's illegal.  I went NC with my overly invasive and controlling narcissistic parents about 6 months before I met my fiance. A year later they hired a PI because I refused to speak with them, then they found out i was a sex worker and tried to blackmail me back into contact with them, they told me to either quit immediately and move home with them or they turn me in. And they went on a whole rant about how no good man would ever want me (my man is college educated, has a great job and treats me like a queen, jokes on them) , and let's just say they none of the rest of the stuff they said was very pleasant.  But when they threatened police I said ""do you have that number or should I get it for you?"" (Via text) They convinced themselves this must be the reason I went NC (its not, was just a way for them to avoid accountability). 

They did call the police, luckily i got a  sympathetic detective who (in his own words) ""had more important things to worry about"" He called me informing me my parents made the report,  all he asked was if I was being trafficked/being forced to do this against my will, told him no. Then he said ""your parents sound exhausting, Have a good day let me know if you need anything. "" I got lucky. 

Now my aunt (whom I'm close with) told me my parents are dying to come to my wedding, and they ""agreed"" to sit in the very back and not interact with me, just want to watch me get married. I told her ""when hell freezes over. Plus they said I'd never get a man bc I'm a whore, remember?"" She said my parents live in the 19th century, they overreacted and she does not at all condone or agree with how they handle things, but as a parent she can understand they were ""worried"" about me, and they ""don't understand"" the adult industry, that they handled things poorly but weren't trying to be cruel, that in their mind they ""were doing whatever it takes to save their childs life."" That they're really sad and miss me and want to see me get married (they've never attempted to apologize). 

I told her they are dead to me for calling the cops, never mind the narcissistic abuse i suffered as a kid. I never want to see them again and that is final.

Plus they said I'd never have a man anyway so why should they come.

"Before i start keep note that i suck at story telling so im pretty sure this post will be chaotic and all over the place also this is my first time on reddit so please bear with me 😓.
Hello i am a 14 year old girl and my dad is 49 years old. My dad is in a relationship with this other girl that he found not even a month after my parents divorce she has a daughter.My mom who is 39 divorced my dad almost a year ago. The reason for the divorce was because she started to realize that my dad is a crazy narcissist.

So abt a month ago my dad sends an email saying that he wants to sell the house (my dad threatened not to pay his half of the house if she didint sell it) me,my mom and my sister (8yo) are currently staying in. Mind you my dad “coincidentally” brings this up right after my mom told him she got fired. My mom found a very good job within a week of getting fired bc she is just that amazing. Me and my dad were already on a rocky relationship and it got worse when my dad said this to my mom “ i dont care if u get indebted or get kicked out of the house as long as i get my money” at this point me and my sister saw him once day a month bc he had moved to Toronto and on top of that he had stopped paying child support. A week of two pass by and my mom manages to bargain with him so he could sell his share at a fair price and when my mom tells him she got accepted for the loan and yk what that dumbass says”send proof” 🙃. A few days before signing the house i get a phone call from my dad and he starts screaming at me telling me to give the phone to my mom, my mom had just almost passed out , i tell him shes very dizzy and cant rn he starts yelling even louder and i tell him i will hang up if he doesnt calm down he calms down a bit and tells me that if i speak to him that way he will never talk to me again i say ok and give him to my mom and turns out he was only looking for document that my mom found in five minutes. After that he texted me and said that my mom cant raised me bc  she isint raised well that was my last straw i told him that if he never wans to talk to me again then fine i also told him that if he just wants to insult me and my mom he can piss off and that i will block him i said alot more and ik that hes my dad but im also his daughter how can he treat me in such an inhumane way i blocked him and have not heard of him since.

Hello i am a 14 year old girl and my dad is 49 years old. My dad is in a relationship with this other girl that he found not even a month after my parents divorce she has a daughter.My mom who is 39 divorced my dad almost a year ago. The reason for the divorce was because she started to realize that my dad is a crazy narcissist. Many things happened ever since the divorce (and before) it’s honestly crazy i dont think i can even say them all so im gonna talk about what he tried to do recently

"117 (m) and my 5 also 17(f) friends have an old friend (17 m) who we'll call T. T would constantly ask if he had done something wrong multiple times a day even if we hadn't spoken to him, we understood were he was coming from for a while as we are also all mentally unstable but this had gone on for months and was starting to take a tole on us. A few months ago T started to message us and if we did not respond he would start to call us asking if he had done anything wrong or done anything wrong to any members of the group; most of us have job and would get in trouble for checking our phones at work to reply (he always seems to message at the time of other commitments which made it frustrating).One Sunday, he spam called and spam messaged us, one of my friends was at work and the others just busy with other things, I was Ill so just trying to sleep.The next day he came into college and he asked us about the situation and we all tried to move on, after this he walked off and left all our group chats and blocked us on all socials; a few of us noticed and we were messaging each other to try to figure out why, he was sat reading these messages over our shoulder in class. When back eating lunch he came over and asked us if we seen he had left. He also attempted to guilt trip me and one other by saying he was ""going to do something to himself"" I told him not to but he walked off soon after. The group has split now around 50/50 the 2 girls who hang out with him now don't seem to enjoy his company but feel bad for him;they often mouth ""help"" at us when waking past them. As well, we have heard from the two girls that he is scared he will ""use his fists"" if he sees any of us. I feel like we did the right thing by leaving the group but also fer bad for abandoning our other friends. So..AITB?

Update: so a small update. One of my friends went to America over Christmas brake and is getting gifts there, she posted a photo of a foot ball shop to a group chat with everyone (T loved American football) she wrote “t could have had a nice gift but o well” this was obviously a joke but the other girls on the group chat told us to “leave him alone” and that “he’s over it so we should as-well” this is wrong because we barely talk about him and try to ignore him when we can but he always stares at us witch is super creepy.

"Hi, so I(15), went with my grandmother(52) to return bottles today. We had been busy due to the holidays, and haven’t had the chance to return bottles in a couple months. Now, whenever I go here and this certain guy is working, he always yells at me. Whether it’s about rain/snow being in the bags, or dirty cigarette filled cans(my mum smokes and is an idiot who keeps putting the trash filled cans in the bottle bag, not the trash bag.)

However, today I went in, we had around 10 bags, we usually have 4-6, and I could tell he was automatically in a mood, because he kept glaring at me as I brought the bottles in. After he got done with the guy in-front of me, and that guy left he walked over to me and automatically started yelling at me,

The guy: You know, how about you guys don’t bring a fucking truck load in again because I need to go take a fucking shit and I’m the only one working, and I have to do this shit by hand so it’ll take a couple fucking hours. 

Me: Uh..

The guy: You probably don’t fucking care, do you!?

Before I continue, I want to mention that he did not count by hand, he had a machine that did it, but, I like stood there, shocked for a second and then went back out to the car and told my grandmother. My grandmother was obviously mad because he swore and yelled at her 15 year old grandchild. The second he saw her walk in his demeanor changed from a total dick wad to nice, like it always happens when she comes in. The only thing he said to her is he won’t accept ice filled bags, which ours weren’t, and to put the bags upside down so they aren’t soaking wet. He wasn’t even yelling at being accusatory like he does when it’s just me and him in there, he was being nice.

So my grandmother obviously wanted to speak to his manager, so we went into the like store where you cash the tickets in for money, but the guy that helped us didn’t speak English, so we called and were told that they only have a manager on duty on Monday, it was Friday. So now she’s spitefully waiting for Monday so she can call and report him.

I don’t know, I guess I’m only posting to ask if I’m the buttface, because he was kind of right, we didn’t need to bring in that many bags, but I don’t know. AITBF?

Edit: 
She called, the manager said that they were sorry, and would talk to him. Meaning, they probably aren’t going to do anything, so yeah.

"Using a burner OK, so I (a 19-year-old trans man) am occasionally hooking up with a dude(20M) who we’ll call Joe for this, for about 6 months. 

I am Asexual and do not have any romantic or sexual attraction towards Joe. 

So Joe and I started hooking up occasionally not that long after I started T. For the uneducated a common side effect of testosterone is suddenly having the sex drive of a teenage boy. Before I started I had almost none. I expressed my discomfort to a trans-masc discussion group I was in. One of the guys said they had a cis friend, Joe, who was saying that they were looking for a hookup. 
Now we meet up a few times a month, He fucks me and I make him dinner and some stuff for the week  I never stay long And every time I leave I would get a rash, it took me a while, like three weeks ago to realize. For context I’m allergic to everything, not literally but the list is long. Being broke out in some rash or hives or both is pretty normal for me. 

I had been hive-free for a week and me and joe moved our appointment to a weekend instead of a weekday like usual. We did the usual But I had nowhere to be the next day and neither did he so we decided I would crash on his couch and his roommates could deal with it( there actually really cool about the whole thing, mine are not which is why we meet at joes). But when I went to lie down I noticed a rash starting to appear on the right backside of my thigh. That’s when it clicked it had to be something on the towel. I hadn't come in contact with anything else. 
So I ask Joe, and he insists that it’s clean or was and he only ever has used a clean towel. I believe him. Joe looks at the hives and he seems concerned and asks if I know what else it could be. I then asked him what detergent he uses, I’m allergic to a few and I don’t know why it never crossed my mind he might use one of them. 

Joe says he uses Tide.

Bingo! 

Joe says he is sorry and the at he didn't know 
And then ask Joe if he would be willing to change his detergent. 

He says he’s willing. He asks which ones he should avoid. I tell him and everything goes on like it never happened. Joe has never complained about the request.

My friends however thought differently. I thought I was telling a funny anecdote. When I brought it up to some of them when we were hanging out. And the topic of my stupid allergies came up. I told them the part about the towel and how I figured it out. They pretty much concluded that it was a dick move for me to ask him to do that. 

Basically, because we are not actually dating a request like that is uncalled for. And that it’s not fair to Joe to have to change what he’s comfortable with because I get a little itchy after. This is a valid point we are not.It is technically true that I could just pop a Benadryl and deal with it like I do everything else. 

And now they have me thinking maybe that was wrong of me to ask of him.  Was that a jerk move?[update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/s/xXO7YpkcjR)","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-09T07:04:43.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a burner OK, so I (a 19-year-old trans man) am occasionally hooking up with a dude(20M) who we’ll call Joe for this, for about 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;

"I’m staying at a short-term apartment. My current lease ends in December, but due to job-related stuff, I had to extend my lease to the end of January (since this is a short-term rental place, this is normal. My property is owned by a couple, Brad and Stacey (fake, obviously). Before the incident, I only talked to Brad. Brad is cool. I’ve only received emails from Stacey where she listed her name at the bottom, but I've never met her.

I wrote them an email asking them to extend my lease. When I was writing the email, I didn’t know Stacey’s name off the top of my head. Her previous emails were still in my inbox, but since I'm paying her rent, I didn't think it was essential to look up her specific name, so I wrote the email starting with “Hey Brad and Brad's wife,” followed by my request and an extension.

Brad got back to me a week later, saying I had to meet with him before he could approve a lease extension. It took three days to schedule this meeting, with him canceling numerous times, but I thought I’d be signing a new lease, so I made it work.

I went into his office, and he said, “My Job as the landlord is to ensure we have a safe and supportive community in our apartment. It is not okay to refer to someone as a ‘wife.’”

“Is she not your wife?” I interjected.

“She is, but she’s more than just a wife. She is the building manager and has a name. Stacey. Her name is Stacey. So, in your emails, you should refer to her as Stacey, or if not, say’ Building Management.’ If you are unable, then I will not extend your lease.”

This meeting or lecture from my landlord lasted around ten minutes. Being essentially threatened with eviction. I just agreed, sucked it up, and fake apologized.

Frankly, I don’t feel like I did anything wrong; I don’t know her very well, and she is his wife. If I had a wife, I would want her to feel proud to be my wife and not ashamed. But my female comrades say it's dehumanizing to address a woman as their husband’s wife and lightly misogynistic.

AITB?

&amp;#x200B;

Update: My roommate read this post, and he said I made a mistake in the details. Brad owns the Property. The only thing Stacey does is handle the business emails. He objected to me referring to Stacey as a landlord because, technically, she's not.  He also said that most other tenants had similar bad interactions with Stacey as he refers to her as ""A Wife from Hell"". Frankly, I don't know if this changes any of the facts, but he's pretty insistent.

After having depressive episodes over a lot of anxiety too over having no friends and wasting my life away. I decide to get in contact with a few old ones and they were generally nice. However I left them on seen a few months ago because it’s like a safety blanket for me. I know it’s not nice to do that but I can’t break out of it. It affects my whole family my anxiety etc. 

1 of them have been sending me pics of us from years ago and I seen them and don’t reply I feel horrible. I also feel embarrassed I haven’t made a single new friend after leaving high school while she has oodles of them.

"(This personally happened to a friend of mine who asked me to put this here, but I've changed a few things for anonymity) My friend, Amelia (14f at the time) was close friends with her classmate, Sam (15f). At the beginning of the school year, a pair of twins joined their class, Alex(15m) and Oscar(15m). After a few weeks, Amelia began to notice that  Sam acted a little strange around Alex, and she suspected that Sam had a crush on him, but she didn't say anything. Then Alex reached out to Amelia and asked whether she knew that Sam had a crush on him, Amelia said yeah, she suspected it. Alex then told her that he had a gf so he needed Amelia's help to tell Sam(because they always hung out together and Alex thought that they were best friends). Amelia agreed, and she began to plan with Alex about how they were going to tell her. They also talked about other random stuff, like books and movies and different experiences. They quickly became friends and talked about everything, and he was one of the first people he told about him and his brother moving. Then he told her that he broke up with his gf, then that he started to like Sam. But at this time Amelia already had a slight crush on him, but as she was surprisingly good at hiding her feelings, so Alex had no idea. Alex didn't want to date Sam but he still liked her, so the plan to tell Sam the whole story still went on. Amelia didn't want to be \*that\* girl who likes her friend's crushes, so she forced herself to turn her attention to Oscar. Then Sam, Alex and Oscar went for VBS(Vacation Bible School) &amp; apparently something happened for Sam to stop liking Alex and Start dating Oscar, without telling Amelia. Eventually Amelia just decided to keep away from boys for the time being because all of that scarred her.

"AITA for going off on someone for recording me?

I am a teenager F. I go to therapy and one therapy I go too is a group therapy, called DBT  which is a behavior therapy, there were three people, teenagers as well, me and two others, and two therapists. I had a episode and fainted, which never happened before and at the end I was rolled out to my ride via wheelchair.

Some kid that (apparently, I do not know) used to go to my high school recorded me and posted it on social media (Snapchat) on my high school 2025 story. Stories are made for when they graduate but she says I shouldn’t be able to see the other stories. I can, and everyone else can.

 She said she deleted the post 25 minutes afterwards even though it was posted yesterday and I saw it today after 3:00 pm , or 15:00. 

The thing she isn’t allowed to record someone or post it on social media due to the place be a therapy site, and the guidelines of DBT. We where DBT and she was the only one with her phone, and she blames the other girl for it, even though she was nowhere near me and didn’t seem have her phone on her. The spot I was recorded at was right where the main girl recorded. Here is what happened after I contacted her.

I will call her MP, mean person.

MP: hello???  Who is this??

ME: OP from DBT. The person you posted on the 2025 story.

A few minutes later 

ME: I wanted to ask why you did that.

"So... I've been pen pals with this guy since 2008 named Dylan. We met online and would correspond through MSN Messenger.

By 2013 I was going through a hard year and his personality was becoming increasingly insufferable. He'd block me, unblock me, constantly have petty arguments... So I blocked him for three full years. I couldn't deal with it.

And it would have been permanent too. But he'd frequently send me emails over the years saying how much he missed me and how sorry he was for his behavior, begging me to unblock. So in late 2015, I added him to Discord.

In recent times, we've taken similar journeys that we connect over. In 2018 we both started investing in the stock market and I ended up investing heavily into crypto and making an insane amount of money from it. My friend, on the other hand, has always been extremely stubborn and dogmatic about crypto (which is an opinion of his I respect). But he's refused to familiarize himself with it because of this. It wasn't until last year that he finally came around to crypto and has no started investing small amounts into Bitcoin.

Because of this, we connect over finances...

And about a week ago, since we're pen pals, I left an innocuous message on Discord *''Wewww. Looks like another crypto bull run is here. We both know it's been coming but looks like it's picking up some steam! Bitcoin is now at $42,000 and Ethereum is now at $2,200!''*

It was a throwaway statement of excitement. But it pissed him off...

Dylan: I like how you give me little updates on Bitcoin price as if I don't follow it daily and haven't been invested for the past three months.

(I thought this was a ridiculous nitpick to make). I was just being friendly.

Me: You do this to me all the time though... The only difference is that I don't call you out on it because I don't take it personally.

Dylan: Do I???? When????

Me: All the time.

Dylan: Say what you want to discuss instead of giving me information I'm already privy to. ""Bitcoin is up, despite what people have predicted."" I can work with that.

Me: You're being awfully pedantic...

Dylan: Well, we have an awfully pedantic relationship.

(Okay).

I ended up trying to assuage him by telling him that I think he's amazing and that there's no reason for him to think I'm speaking down to him and he started to calm down.

It's been a week since then... And he's been mostly away. He told me a week ago that his cat had swallowed something and had to be rushed to the hospital for surgery. $900 for x-rays and $1,140 for hospitalization.

I've not really had a conversation with him for a week now as we've never been on at the same time, but I've sent him maybe three offline messages which he didn't respond to.

Then today I woke up to a sarcastic *''thanks for asking about my cat.''*

Seeing as we haven't actually spoken to each other since he told me about his cat the implication is that I should have sent him an offliner asking him how his cat is doing.

Am I the butthead for not asking about his cat?... Like, had we had an actual conversation in real-time, it probably would have come up naturally. But since we haven't been talking I've been busy with my own life so it didn't occur to me to send an offliner asking how his cat is doing.

"I met this girl I really liked. I'm 18, she's 19. We were both living the hookup life. I was a virgin when I got to college, but I lost it as a party months before we met. She told me she wasn't interested in a relationship, too busy with school, but we can hookup. She also told me I was OK to sleep with other people, but, like, wear protection and have common sense.

&amp;#x200B;

So it became. I had the biggest crush on her and followed her everywhere. She is just so fucking cool. She's smart, a great conversationalist, funny, and just fundamentally a good person. She is also bi, btw.

&amp;#x200B;

We got drunk one night and had a heart to heart. She admitted her first bf, who she knew since they were toddlers, passed away in a car accident. If that is not enough her bff, who she ended up dating after, parents found out and got bff to stop talking to her bc they're homophobic. She said love traumatized her, she didn't want to experience it ever again. I said that was really sad, but she assured me she was fufilled with just hookups.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew she wouldn't be mine, so I continued to have flings with other people to tell myself it wasn't real. It was painful bc it felt like we were dating. She would compliment me all the time, we would flirt, hangout, fuck, etc. I asked her once what her type was and she said men who have ""bi wife"" energy. I asked if I fit, &amp; she said I did, I had golden retriever boy energy, and I beamed like crazy, lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate said, to both of us, ""I heard you hooked up with X, congrats, player!"" I looked at her, stressed, but she said oh, I know, she bragged about it, no worries. But she didn't seem jealous to me.

&amp;#x200B;

She come over last weekend and we had sex the whole time. She told me my dick was perfect, I almost passed away. I told her it felt special, sex has never felt like this with anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

She said that was bc we have been sleeping together for awhile and know each others likes, that's all it is. I let it go but I felt weird for the rest of the weekend. It felt special because I loved her.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I waited outside her class after not speaking for a few days and overheard a conversation. Her bff asked about me she said ""oh he's great, but I dunno if he likes me. He's sleeping with other people, and if he liked me he would be focused on me, right?"" She said you aren't exclusive, you can't expect that, she said she knows, she's just jealous.

&amp;#x200B;

I left, panicked and crying. It felt like a whole 180, I thought she was the one who didn't want me? I yelled at my roommate for telling her about the hookup to her face, it was misplaced anger on my part. But I don't get why I got flamed. If I asked for a relationship, I could come off creepy. I respected what she said, and hooked up with other people. Is that being an AH? I was also scared she would realize I caught feelings and cut me out. It's strange because so many people criticized me and called me a fuckboy, like slut shaming, for not telling her how I felt &amp; sleeping w other people?

&lt;p&gt;She come over last weekend and we had sex the whole time. She told me my dick was perfect, I almost passed away. I told her it felt special, sex has never felt like this with anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that was bc we have been sleeping together for awhile and know each others likes, that&amp;#39;s all it is. I let it go but I felt weird for the rest of the weekend. It felt special because I loved her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I waited outside her class after not speaking for a few days and overheard a conversation. Her bff asked about me she said &amp;quot;oh he&amp;#39;s great, but I dunno if he likes me. He&amp;#39;s sleeping with other people, and if he liked me he would be focused on me, right?&amp;quot; She said you aren&amp;#39;t exclusive, you can&amp;#39;t expect that, she said she knows, she&amp;#39;s just jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left, panicked and crying. It felt like a whole 180, I thought she was the one who didn&amp;#39;t want me? I yelled at my roommate for telling her about the hookup to her face, it was misplaced anger on my part. But I don&amp;#39;t get why I got flamed. If I asked for a relationship, I could come off creepy. I respected what she said, and hooked up with other people. Is that being an AH? I was also scared she would realize I caught feelings and cut me out. It&amp;#39;s strange because so many people criticized me and called me a fuckboy, like slut shaming, for not telling her how I felt &amp;amp; sleeping w other people? IDK how?&lt;/p&gt;

"For context: I(22) my house is 1 hour away from the university that she is at right now when my gf (F22) texted me and said she has blood stains on her pants because of the period she's having. I told her to go home and change clothes since her apartment is 15 mins away from the university. She said no because it was embarrassing and I told her that I'll go to her apartment to grab her clothes to change but it'll take 1 hour or more because of the travel time. I asked her if she was willing to wait that long and she said no again. She then began to tell me ""You always tell me to go home when emergencies happen to me"" to which I replied: ""It's better right now for you to go home so you don't have to worry about who's going to see the stains for the entire duration you're there"". She told me no because if she stands or walks, it might get messier. She then told me ""It's so easy for you to send me home. You always tell me to find someone else for help"" and I said ""I'm sorry I'm just trying to help you. If I can't be there physically, and if you can't help yourself, then maybe someone else can. Okay, I'll go to the apartment anyways despite the travel time"". She replied with no and that she's done with our relationship.

I can understand why she reacts like this. This happened last year too when she had menstrual cramps in the uni and I was at home. I told her to go to the nurse and have your friends help you since there's a nurse there. She got really pissed and cut contact for a day. She may be having flashbacks to that moment.

So reddit, AITB for telling my gf to go home or find someone to help with her period stain problem?




UPDATE:

I went to my gf's apartment and talked to her. We're really done now.

I went to my gf's apartment a few hours later, her fave coffee on one hand, and we talked. When i arrived she was already super pissed. Anyway, the talk went something this: 

Me: ""I offered you solutions as to how to solve the period stain problem""

Her: ""Offering me solutions isn't helping! The distance between me and the bathroom or the infirmary were too far!""

Me: (confused): ""So was I! I was giving you help that was immediate because I'm far away!""

Her: ""No if only you had the initiative to leave immediately we wouldn't be having this problem! Your first instinct was to push me away to someone else!""

Me: ""My first instinct was to help you immediately by offering solutions!""

Her: ""How was that helpful?""

And on and on and on round and around the conversation went. Eventually she said that I was selfish and that I didn't sacrifice enough for her. Safe to say we're really really done now. I'm going home and eat my guts out to make up for the tears I'm having.


ANOTHER EDIT:
For those saying that I should have sympathized with her and to ask if what she wanted was help or just a shoulder to cry on. Let me remind that the entire reason she was mad was because I didn't go to her IMMEDIATELY. She wanted me to go to her right that instant regardless of the consequences that could entail to her. And when I asked if it was okay that it would take an hour, she said no. I considered every other option to help her because she was already panicking from possible embarrassment. I told her where the nearby infirmary was and said it was too far. I told her to phone a friend and she said no that would be embarrassing as well. I told her to call a stranger or someone to help you and said ""It's going to be embarrassing but they would understand you"". All those options she utterly refused.

And to those who told me to track her menstrual cycle, she has an irregular cycle. So it would either come late, early, or not at all.

"A week ago I (22 M) saw Bob (21 M) at a local pub, we ended up at the same table, it was clear that Bob was drunk out of his mind and very upset, although we never spoke he kept texting me throughout the night. He was said he was sorry for ""whatever he did"" to me and that he never meant ""any disrespect by whatever it was."" He wanted an explaination as to why I've cut him, and that entire social circle, out. Initially I said yes to his request but am now having second thoughts, we have yet to set a time.

Me and Bob were friends during High School and shared the same social circle, at the time I thought everything was fine and they were a source of comfort. I identify as bisexual and the general environment was pretty homophobic, but in my mind the rest of the lads had my back, this was a good reassurance then.

About six months ago I got a very upset/drunken voice message from a friend, Carl (21 M). The basics is that they were messaging to apologise for all the ""homophobia"" and ""bullying"" they did with the others throughout school. I hadn't a clue what he meant so talked to them when they were sober. They told me that;

* Almost my entire friendgroup was either homophobic, or biphobic specifically, with me and another bi friend being the targets. Carl himself is gay but claimed he was scared of going against the crowd and so never did anything about it, there was another gay member who he says was also in on it.

* Apparently among the group my nickname was ""the faggot."" The source of every rumour, heresay and insult about me came from them.

* Any individual I admitted having a crush on to them was viciously bullied and subject to more homophobia behind my back over it. I can confirm that my crushes always seemed distant afterwards but I always chalked it up to disinterest.

* Apparently there were numerous group chats, trips abroad, and 21st parties organised behind my and the other bi guys back.

At the time I was shocked, Carl clarified who he knew for a fact where in on it. He did not know if Bob or another guy (Rob, 20 M) were involved. Initially I did not belief Carl but after talking through it with other friends realised he had no reason to lie, eventually I called Rob and subtely asked him. He confirmed just about every detail Carl gave me, dates, times, locations, people, and even that I had a secret nickname but when I changed the conversation to ask about what exactly they'd say about me or what that nickname was he shut down the conversation and tried to back track. This made me more almost certain that what Carl told me had to be close to the truth, according to Rob Bob was present for most of these events.

I have cut them all out of my life since, but I am unsure what to do about Bob now. He seemed genuinaley upset and confused at the pub and I have no concrete evidence that he was involved, yet I'm not sure I want to even bother having that conversation with him considering all the circumstantials.

"There  was a guy I went on a date, Jensen. He is known for being a good guy,  but he wasn't interested in a relationship. He said he wanted to only  have casual sex, and I also like that idea, so I asked him out.

He is really hot, like movie actor hot. I also heard from a friend that the sex was great. I went on a date with him, and I was really horny and  looking to get laid but he turned me down.

He  said he didn't feel the spark. I was humiliated, like I put myself out  there asking him to have sex with me and he rejected me. It was obvious  what happened, why he rejected me. It was because I tried to have sex on  the first date. He is a sexist, slut-shamer.

What made it worse is that he is good friends with my roommate, Gen, and so he would naturally be around.

I  would make sure to make snide comments when he was around. One day his  bff was over, and they were talking how this girl didn't call him back  for a second date, but they slept together on the first date.

I  said ""Oh, it's probably because you put out on the first date,"" which  made me feel happy because yeah, women can slut shame too. But Jensen  cut in and said, ""That is super unlikely. Ignore her, she's obsessed with people's sexual history and that isn't something most women care  about, it was more likely because of x,y, z.""

I  was immediately taken aback, I made a few comments about how many  people he's slept with, etc, but I only did that because he slut shamed  me first. So I said that, that he slut shamed me, he wouldn't sleep w me  bc it was our first date &amp; he judged me.

He  said ""what? I don't care about that. Trust me, when I meet my person,  we are fucking on sight. I just didn't want to sleep with you.""

I said no, that's not true, I know the real reason. But we got into an argument.

I  said it's fine, I only sleep with virgins now, I don't date people who do casual sex. I said why would I have a relationship with someone who  has slept with a lot of people, it's like someone who has tried a bunch  of candy, how will I know they'll be good with just me? He said you're  the one slut shaming, but candy is nothing like sex. It's sad to think  the only reason your partner isn't cheating on you is because they  haven't touched another vagina. You've also slept around. Why would you be OK with one dick when you've had multiple?

I  was really disgusted by him asking me that. You shouldn't bring someone's sexual history up like that. I said he doesn't get it, when he sleeps around women find him more attractive and it's the opposite for me and that hurts. He  said no, I do feel bad. It's sad people care about that, but dating an 18 year old virgin isn't the answer. He said I can find men who don't care, he doesn't care, and he feels people who are sexually active are  more interesting and fun anyway.

I  thought we left off in an okay place, but now I feel bad. AITA? Did I  slut shame him? Or was I right to be upset? I feel I may have come off a bit bitter, but I thought he slut shamed me.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-09T04:10:54.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There  was a guy I went on a date, Jensen.

So I said that, that he slut shamed me, he wouldn&amp;#39;t sleep w me  bc it was our first date &amp;amp; he judged me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He  said &amp;quot;what? I don&amp;#39;t care about that. Trust me, when I meet my person,  we are fucking on sight. I just didn&amp;#39;t want to sleep with you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said no, that&amp;#39;s not true, I know the real reason. But we got into an argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  said it&amp;#39;s fine, I only sleep with virgins now, I don&amp;#39;t date people who do casual sex. I said why would I have a relationship with someone who  has slept with a lot of people, it&amp;#39;s like someone who has tried a bunch  of candy, how will I know they&amp;#39;ll be good with just me? He said you&amp;#39;re  the one slut shaming, but candy is nothing like sex. It&amp;#39;s sad to think  the only reason your partner isn&amp;#39;t cheating on you is because they  haven&amp;#39;t touched another vagina. You&amp;#39;ve also slept around. Why would you be OK with one dick when you&amp;#39;ve had multiple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  was really disgusted by him asking me that. You shouldn&amp;#39;t bring someone&amp;#39;s sexual history up like that. I said he doesn&amp;#39;t get it, when he sleeps around women find him more attractive and it&amp;#39;s the opposite for me and that hurts. He  said no, I do feel bad. It&amp;#39;s sad people care about that, but dating an 18 year old virgin isn&amp;#39;t the answer. He said I can find men who don&amp;#39;t care, he doesn&amp;#39;t care, and he feels people who are sexually active are  more interesting and fun anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  thought we left off in an okay place, but now I feel bad. AITA? Did I  slut shame him? Or was I right to be upset? I feel I may have come off a bit bitter, but I thought he slut shamed me.&lt;/p&gt;

"For some context, I work part-time and besides housing and food, I pay for everything else I need and all my finances are separate from my family. 

Recently I decided to buy myself a pair of good quality house slippers as my old ones were finally going, and I'm tired of being new ones every year. I had to save for them, but knowing they would last me a long time was worth waiting. When they arrived, I tried them on and left the shoe box at the bottom of the steps, which my parents and siblings all have a habit of too. I left to go to work, and they were gone when I got back home. None of my siblings would take them either, as we all have different shoe sizes. 

For two months I continuously asked both my parents about it and recently my mom admitted she might have accidentally thrown them out with the rest of the cardboard recycling. She didn't apologize but offered me the money to buy a new pair. I accepted even though the slippers were now out of stock because at least I would be able to buy a different kind.

Today I'm walking into my house and notice my new slippers on the stoop. Still with the cardboard inside, now covered in gunk and soaking wet. I'm guessing the recycling men found and returned them, and I'm grateful to them. My mom saw me walk inside with them and said that I didn't have to worry about the money she gave me, which is nice of her too, but am I overreacting for expecting an apology for making me think I lost out on a lot of money? She saw me frantically searching for months and I told her about how it took me over a month to save for them. I'm not upset about the slippers, I can clean them and she even let me keep the replacement money. 

I'm just upset she never once apologized and I don't know how to talk to her about it.

Then he text her again and says “ yeah you just flirt with all my friends and I don’t like it and you just basically cheated” his friends have been her friends sense kindergarten (we have a school that goes up three k-6 and our “high school” is 7-12). That is where I started to get mad because he was accusing her of cheating so I told her I will send him a message of how crappie he was being and how that wasn’t right to accuse her for something she didn’t do.

Note:may delete for personal reasons (he's a phone checker).

A month ago I had a testicular torsion which is just as horrifying as it sounds. And the doctors were doing a lot of examining. And one time my doctor asked if I'd like him to leave the room and I said yes. And he flat out says. Im watching the TV while dead ass facing me with his eyes facing sideways. Which made me really uncomfortable. Long story short after 3 days I get home and he yells at me for asking me to leave the room cause ""he was trying to protect me"" and the doctor ""looked gay"" and I was just confused. So yeah which brings me to today. Today I had another follow up where I just asked him to turn his back.

&lt;p&gt;A month ago I had a testicular torsion which is just as horrifying as it sounds. And the doctors were doing a lot of examining. And one time my doctor asked if I&amp;#39;d like him to leave the room and I said yes. And he flat out says. Im watching the TV while dead ass facing me with his eyes facing sideways. Which made me really uncomfortable. Long story short after 3 days I get home and he yells at me for asking me to leave the room cause &amp;quot;he was trying to protect me&amp;quot; and the doctor &amp;quot;looked gay&amp;quot; and I was just confused. So yeah which brings me to today. Today I had another follow up where I just asked him to turn his back. And he says how about I look at my phone and in my head I&amp;#39;m angry but I keep my cool and say ok. And the doctor starts and im look to the side and hes NOT LOOKING AT HIS PHONE like his eyes just made it back in time. Which made my heart drop.

"I've had some professional exams through work this week which have been stressful. Work give me the day off work for the exam plus 1 days per exam for study leave. I used some more of my leave to take more time to study then since my last exam is on Friday, I took next Monday off so I had 3 days after my exam where I could just enjoy myself.

My girlfriend and I made plans to go for cocktails and a meal after my exam on Friday and then have days out planned for Saturday and Sunday. I planned to have Monday to just not leave the apartment and just chill out. I planned to read, watch Netflix and play video games. My girlfriend mentioned that she also has Monday off work and started talking about plans we can make. I mentioned what I was planning to do and she got annoyed.

She said she thought we could do something together since we haven't done much lately due to me studying for exams. I pointed out we had things planned for Friday, Saturday and Sunday and that we had plans the following weekend. 

She just repeated that she thought I'd want to spend time doing things with her. I mentioned that she is welcome to join me in relaxing all day but that I would not be doing anything outside the apartment since I just need a day to recharge and decompress because of the stress of the exams. 

She just said I was being unfair since it's been a while since we've been out but I just repeated that we have plenty planned for this weekend and next weekend so I should be allowed to just have a day to relax but she said I was being selfish?

"i (18f) asked a guy (19f) out last week. he said no. it embarrassed me and i was really sad he said no because i really like him. i’ve been trying to avoid him and move on ever since, but it’s hard because i see him at work every day. 

me and my friends had a game night Sunday night and he came. we just played random tabletop games. after a few hours, he started talking about how i asked him out. he didn’t say my name, but he mocked me and made fun of me. my friends went along with it because they didn’t know he was talking about me, but i did. he was sitting 2 feet away from me. he knew i heard. he was 100% talking about me because he included a detail that was super specific to our situation. there’s no way that was unintentional. i understand he’s not responsible for how i feel and he doesn’t have to censor himself for my feelings, but i also think it’s fair for me to be upset about it and he could have some empathy. 

anyway, i got up and left in the middle of the game and ignored my friends calls and texts when they asked me what was wrong. im embarrassed i reacted this way. i didn’t lash out or yell at anyone, but i did ignore them and randomly leave. they all texted me telling me i made them uncomfortable by being so upset. i didn’t mean to show i was upset. i was just really embarrassed by how he was mocking me and making fun of me right in front of my face and all my friends went along with it and made fun of me too because they didn’t know he was talking about me. i told them why i was upset, and they told me i was acting like a toddler and have terrible communication skills. they said im putting a wedge in the friend group. am i in the wrong here? i feel like im going crazy because i seriously don’t think im the person they should be angry at right now.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-05T06:27:53.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i (18f) asked a guy (19f) out last week. he said no. it embarrassed me and i was really sad he said no because i really like him. i’ve been trying to avoid him and move on ever since, but it’s hard because i see him at work every day. &lt;/p&gt;

" 

Me (18F) and my friend (18M-X) have been friends with this guy (19-Y) from our class for 5 years (known him for 8). Y's always had a lot of issues and I've always tried to help Y, even before befriending him.

He's had a lot of issues at school and doesn't usually talk, so I'd be randomly pulled out of class to explain his behaviour, missing lessons and coming out of the office stressed. He almost never thanked us and often was rude when reminded of schoolwork. When we realised it made him uncomfortable, we stopped reminding him. This led to him almost having to repeat a year.

The morning of prom, he texted me and X that he was planning to 'disappear like Cinderella before midnight', which was when the second performance where I was paired up with him was meant to take place. He told us, that his girlfriend wanted to leave early and that 'what gf says must be done'. We started a long argument, which lasted over an hour, trying to explain to him how betrayed we felt, since this was the first thing we'd ever asked of him and he'd decided the morning of the ball, which meant we probably wouldn't have enough time to find a substitute. That meant that I wouldn't be able to perform as well, wasting months of practice. He said that 'just because you just found out, doesn't mean I've only just decided'.

After 40mins of explaining our pov, Y told us that apparently he'd misunderstood his girlfriend, said 'sorry' and told us to 'stop whining about it'. We told him that we didn't care about what his girlfriend said and that the problem was that he now has responsibility towards other people too, not just her. After that, he agreed to stay and leave only after we were done.

During the ball, he kept reassuring me he would stay. An hour before the second performance, he started to leave without telling anybody. After finding out, we tried to stop him, offering help and were met with a blank stare. He just attempted to push past us, before walking back towards the lockers, and also to the back door, which I failed to realise but X didn't. He stalled him for 25min, freezing (-4°C).

When I got there, I waited a few minutes for Y and his girlfriend to say anything, but they didn't, they just stared at me. I announced that I was freezing already and that I couldn't deal with this today of all days and just left. After that, they too left.

It's been a few days, we left all common groupchats (didn't block him tho) and Y hasn't apologised or said anything to us regarding the ball. One of our mutual friends has contacted us to convey a message, saying that Y is sorry. Y's girlfriend told me that she dislikes the way I'm handling the situation and that I am overreacting. His mother texted me in an oddly formal way, saying she wants to discuss something.

I haven't responded to his girlfriend or mum and refuse to handle this over intermediaries when he is perfectly capable of texting me himself.

She called me to let me know she'll be checking in on me and this would be all well and good if she actually checked in on me like she said she was.

"I (20F) had a cat for about 8 years. She suddenly died August 31st, 2022, @10pm. In October of that year, I adopted my dog (now 2y/o) to train him to be my service dog.

A bit of context about this; My cat, SamSam, was practically born in my lap. I was there from the moment of her birth to her death, which was sudden and premature (brain cancer @ 8). Emotionally, she was my daughter. We went through a lot together.

When I adopted Maui, my dog, I ensured my mother was his “mom”. We’re partners, but she is his mom. I love Maui dearly, we’re very close and just 3 months into his adoption we already had a bond so deep the trainers were shocked. But I don’t love him like I love SamSam. 

She was the love of my life and the heart of my heart… things I can’t quite say about Maui. I love him immensely, I spoil him and support him and tell him all the time that I love him. But I don’t love him the same way, or with the same intensity, as my deceased cat.

"Hey, So I’m Rin, (F16). And my boyfriend is S, (M16)

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a whole year and my experiences with him hasn’t been great or the best. But I still stood my ground to stay because I thought he would’ve changed for the better

This one scenario was I felt like I had to becareful about everything I do around him because he got hurted by the way I talk about my interests or myself or Just literally sending my music taste to him that reminded me of him. In Summary, When I said that, He started to say:

“Thank you for making me feel like I’m not able to be vulnerable”

That day, I started to beg on my knees and apologise to him in a whole paragraph telling me how I’m an asshole and everything because he got mad, He then responded with 

“Your words are cheap, They don’t matter to me.”

“Yes, You really are an asshole”

“You’re always so stupid”

After he said that, He never talked to me after 2 days which he apologised for what he said and did.

Second Scenario:

This one time I had a mental breakdown about something, Saying he should break up with me and find someone else better than me, Which he replied

“Okay! I can just find someone so much better than you quickly and leave you all alone!”

Which hurted.

Third Scenario:

There had been times he didn’t take conversation’s seriously, Whenever I expressed my feelings, He gets so sarcastic and passive aggressive. He’d say:

“Yeah yeah, You’re right”

“Okay, Same, I don’t care at all”

“Yeah yeah, Alright”

“I would rather not see you cry about this”

And he’d do that to the point I snapped at him and he would portray me as the bad guy for reacting what he did to hurt me

Fourth Scenario:

He would be so manipulative if I can’t buy him anything he wants but Can make it (I crochet)

He originally wanted a Fox plushie which at first I already specified that I can only crochet something for him. The fox plushie was 37$ and I don’t have that kind of money, When I politely told him I couldn’t afford it, He said:

“I feel like I’m not worth your 30$” and get absolutely upset.

Fifth Scenario:

He would get upset over how I react to how he hurts me rather than how I felt when he did, I could tell him I felt hurt but when I react to the fact he kept hurting me, He makes me the bad guy

Conclusion:

AITB to leave this one year relationship that had always been like this? He said he has a method to prevent being manipulative and I kept on wanting to stay even though he had also ever physically assaulted me and forced me into sex.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-04T23:25:39.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, So I’m Rin, (F16).

"This is super super low stakes but serious nonetheless. My (24f) bf (29M) brought home a plastic cutting board because he's tired of my rules with the wooden cutting boards. I do 90% of the cooking because I find that I'm the pickier eater and I enjoy cooking much more than he does. This has led to me having some idiosyncrasies surrounding the kitchen equipment. 

I have one giant cutting board that I use for meats and aromatics, and one much smaller board that I use for fruits or small foods with weak flavors. However, I cut larger fruits or melons on the back of the meat board. I use the back purely because of flavor reasons. I've had more than my fair share of garlicky honeydew from using the wrong board as a kid, so I'm pretty adamant about not cutting fruits on the front side. We used to have a 3rd board that was medium sized and was for ""anything that isn't onions, garlic, or chicken"" but that board was made poorly and snapped a while ago.

Lately I've been burnt out and have asked him to do more cooking. I haven't whipped him to death over my cutting board rules, but he knows they exist. He doesn't want to commit them to memory, which is fine I guess. Because of this, he wanted a new cutting board just for himself. I don't have any objections to that, but he brought home a bright blue plastic cutting board.

I don't like plastic cutting boards and I never really have. I've always found them dirty and I don't really want all the extra microplastics from the cutting board getting into my food. With a wooden board, you'll mostly get wood bits in your food and you can prevent deep scores with regular maintenance. With a plastic cutting board, scores will happen much quicker and you really have to bleach them to clean them. I know for a fact he's not going to be bleaching this thing, and I personally feel better about chucking or repurposing a wooden board vs a plastic one.

I asked him to either return it or give it to his sister. He said I was being silly and overly picky. I told him I'd personally buy him a new, nicer wooden board and I did not want a plastic cutting board. He again said I was being silly and he said that if he's going to be cooking he's going to be using his plastic board. I haven't let him cook since then and I think he feels rejected now.

Why  am I being shut out? I did nothing wrong. I feel like Lisa is taking  sides. Why do I have to get a separate dinner and not my ex-friend?

Now  I feel like not only did I lose one friend but two. I don't know where to go from here. They were my two best friends and I don't have anyone else besides  my boyfriend. I feel so sad and hurt.

"I know It makes me sound like a buttface but here we go.

I 19M and my best friend 20F have known eachother for years she knows everything about me and I her.

She has this new boyfriend who we will call joe.

She left the room the other day to go the toilet and I was left alone with Josh.

He started talking about how I need to kiss him because I don't seem gay.

I've been out for multiple years.

I've dated multiple men.

I refused to kiss him then he forced his lips on mine I tried to push him off but my best friend came in and saw him kissing me.

She started screaming at me.

She called me a disgusting little homo and said that I have ruined her relastionship.

She slapped me across the face and kicked me out.

She called my sister and my mother and they are on her side. 

So AITB


Update her boyfriend came out as gay and she is STILL saying its my fault their relastionship is over.

I got annoyed at this and told her how she can't blame me when she hasnt kept a single man for over a month.

Which is even sadder because she cheated on some off them.

My cousin supports me in this. He was someone who dated her turns out she isn't just a toxic friend. She doesn't even put on deodorant no wonder the last 12 men left her.

I may seem a bit off a dick here but it has been 7 fucking years off her blaming me for her patheticness.

"

so for context they were a lesbian couple and were dating for about 6 months. her ex suffers from childhood trauma, BPD, autism, anxiety, clinical depression, and anorexia. eventually her mental health started to consume her as soon as the went off to college (they’re freshmen) and they could no longer be in a relationship and agreed to break up. my friend was crushed by this and tried to apologize for anything she did that could’ve hurt her because her ex was claiming that my friend is a toxic abuser. when she tried to ask her what she did wrong she would either never answer or all she would say is “you made me feel genuinely horrible in the relationship” from what I gathered from my friends side of the story, we had some sort of caregiver relationship, because her ex refused to get proper help, even though she was clearly suffering from multiple mental illnesses. her ex also clean that she did not help her enough when she was going through depression and sh episodes. today her ex randomly texted her saying that her apology was pure bullshit and she is in a toxic abuser. My friend asked her exactly what she did to her that made her feel that way and she dropped a bombshell and started accusing her of sa/ rape.

now for even more context, another reason why they ended up breaking up is because her ex was pretty much addicted to weed.

My friend asked her exactly what she did to her that made her feel that way and she dropped a bombshell and started accusing her of sa/ rape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now for even more context, another reason why they ended up breaking up is because her ex was pretty much addicted to weed. She would smoke weed almost every day, and also ask for sex at the same time, apparently from her exes perspective, even when she would consent to sex, she still feels like it was assault because she was high at the time.

"AITB for snapping at my high school principal?

Fucking AITA keeps deleting my posts.

Anyway, I (18m) went to this corrupt private Christian highschool in the middle of nowhere. Sadly, I was bullied because at the time I was a Catholic, not a Lutheran, so the difference in denomination and constantly hearing “you’re going to hell” was a nightmare. Not only that but because of past events, I wasn’t performing well. Even the guidance counselor said to give up and become a pastor, when I told him no, he just said to give up college entirely (I’m currently studying aerospace engineering). I guess the big reason was because when they sent people up to this school in Minnesota to become a pastor, they make money. I also had a racist teacher who called a group of latin american students “gangbangers” and always screwed with them. My girlfriend (18f) was also constantly being attacked and she didn’t do anything.

My principal had a grudge against me, he would always call me into his office for the mildest thing. Sure, I did get pissed off several times because of my classmates and it went out of hand. That was until I found out that the students who donate more got away with things (one kid tried to attack me physically and got out of trouble). I overheard them talking about this and it confirmed they were indeed letting kids who donate get away with things. 

I stayed quiet until my principal got pissed off at me again, this time because of some rumor one of my classmates spread about me. There was the usual “stop being Catholic” and “you’re doomed for hell”. I was sick of it, stood up and told him thay if Martin Luther found out what the school was doing, he would be rolling in his grave (he was the founder of Lutheranism who fought against Catholicism for doing the same thing the school did). The man was speechless, kicked me out, people started actually getting punished, I got some concerning messages from the higher-ups who run the specific synod and my classmates, I stopped getting in trouble, and graduated a few weeks later.

I feel like the asshole because I was always told to never call a fellow Christian out.

She's complaining about the state of our town, complaining about work, talking about us moving apartments in a few months etc. I explained to her that I was feeling burnt out and just wanted to chill out tonight and those conversations were a bit too heavy. I mentioned that I'm off work tomorrow so we can talk about it then.

She doesn't listen and keeps talking about it and expecting me to respond so I repeat that I'm burnt out and just want to relax. She accuses me of not listening to her and not responding to her. I just pointed out that I  had told her I needed to relax and that I'd talk about it the following day since it was nothing urgent that needed to be discussed there and then.

She just says she's not asking for much and that I should be fine with discussing what she was trying to discuss and that she wasn't asking for much but I just repeated that it was not urgent and that I'll be happy to discuss it with her tomorrow.

"At the beginning of this year my (31M) ex-fiancee (31F) broke off our engagement because she wanted to move to LA with a couple of friends, which was something she had always wanted to do. There was no bad blood, but of course I was devastated that the woman I was ready to spend the rest of my life married to wasn't ready for the same.

After getting over the initial shock of the breakup, I decided to book a solo trip to Thailand, both to treat myself and to have something to look forward to.

I spent all of November in Thailand and had a blast. I went to a few different parts of the country, had some amazing experience, and met a lot of amazing people both from Thailand and other parts of the world. I spent one leg of the trip with a girl (22F) I met who was also solo travelling and clicked with (and yes, one thing did lead to another). I didn't brag about sleeping with her on social media, but I did take a couple of photos of us together that ended up in the obligatory ""IG photo dump"" post of my trip.

Apparently, one of our mutual friends gossiped to my ex and sent her a screenshot of the photo (ex and I agreed to limited contact and removed each other from social media). Cue an angry message from my ex telling me that I'm a revolting predator because I was hanging out with a young girls who looked like ""literal children"", and that I was clearly in Thailand for the sex tourism. I told her it was none of her business who I chose to sleep with because we were no longer together, and told her to ""kindly fuck off"".

I've had a few messages from people calling me a ""creepy sexpat"", and ended up taking down the post. I know that age can introduce a power dynamic in a relationship, but it's not like either me or the girl were expecting anything serious to come out of it. She was acutely aware of my age, I'd like to think I treated her with the dignity and respect she deserved, and I never got the vibe she wasn't doing anything she didn't want to do.

"  

So this year is the first of what I am sure will be many terrible Christmases, and I am in two minds about celebrating.

My BPD mum could not care less about Christmas and has not made any attempts to engage. The last time I spent Christmas with her she just whinged and moaned about not being able to spend Christmas as a family, but insisted it’s not really Christmas if we didn't celebrate it in the pub. She isn't an alcoholic, she just likes the social side of the pub. That was the first Christmas without my dad. She did nothing all day and expected me and my sister to run around after her whilst complaining.

Last year I spent it with my ex's family.

Anyway, I now live in a bedsit, and don't see the point of decorating so I haven't. I still buy presents, but I am afraid Christmas day will just be another day. Instead, I asked my sibling if we could go out for the day in the lead up to Christmas, and she said yeah.

Only her work has now made plans for her to do extra unscheduled mandatory extra shifts without warning, this falls on the day we were due to go out. The shifts are only three-hour stints too. She will now work Monday to Saturday week leading up to Christmas. Yet she refuses to go anywhere on a Sunday.

I mentioned going somewhere closer to home if I picked her up from work, but she told me she had plans to spend the time with her friends and got aggressive towards me telling me it would be my fault if she cancels. I told her it doesn't matter, and to just go out with her friends.

The situation was brought up again and again she chose to make me out to be a bully and her the victim. Whilst I would have liked to have gone, it just wasn't going to happen, and I accepted it. I just told her I wasn't going to put any more effort in Christmas since the expectations are just making me upset. 

I don't feel like infringing on a friends Christmas because a lot of them have children, and that's what I grew up with, a small household celebrating Christmas together and I want them to have that experience. My work will have what is branded a reward meal out, but I will probably be expected to pay for it again as with every other reward.

I already told her to just forget making any plans multiple times. I was upset because people literally won’t stop asking me what I will be doing for Christmas, and when I reply just stay at home with crisps and a film people start giving me 50p worth of how 'Christmas is a time for family, and I do x,y and z.'

Anyway, so my sister has decided to lie to me and told me she managed to get the time off instead. She pressured me to buy the tickets for the day out, and it later occurred to me that she had lied. She is now being asked questions at work. So now It is naturally my fault.

She is making me out to be the bully and being manipulative to get what I want. Anyway, so I don't know what the right thing to do is. I feel stupid for having unrealistic expectations, but all around me I am surrounded by pressure to have a Christmas.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-12-04T16:16:26.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this year is the first of what I am sure will be many terrible Christmases, and I am in two minds about celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;

"I (25F) go to a non denominational church. Personally, I believe in God and enjoy the sermons the pastor (30sM) there gives. He is a highly educated and always gives very thought provoking sermons. Even if I don’t agree with everything he says, he is open minded and thought provoking and does not hold other people’s opinions against them. I find that quite attractive.

This last weekend we were supposed to decorate the church for advent/Christmas, but I was the only congregation member who showed up to help. We spent all day decorating and talking, and there were sparks. He was funny and charming and didn’t have any untoward intentions which made the whole day very stress free and fun. By the end I found myself quite taken.

I don’t date, but I do have casual relationships. I don’t want to get into my personal beliefs or the minutiae of it all, but in general I believe God loves us all and that most religions are far too strict. I don’t believe premarital sex is a big deal and I like church mostly because it gives me a sense of community, and gets me out of bed on Sundays so I don’t spend all day taking an extended depression nap.

The pastor knows my beliefs on that, and I know that his do not match mine. I know he does not personally believe premarital sex is okay, but he also doesn’t judge those who do. He’s very into the whole “only God can judge things and that his job is to accept everyone and help everyone no matter their beliefs.”

Anyway, long story short we hooked up. I’ll admit I’m the one who kissed him/initiated, but the escalation from there was both of us. We ended up having sex in the church library without a condom (not like either of us make a habit of bringing condoms with us to church lol). I took Plan B and plan to get tested for STIs in a couple weeks just in case, even though I trust him and doubt he’s got anything.

He talked to me today and asked that we never do it again and that I not mention it to anyone. He’s single so there’s not any cheating to worry about, but he told me he feels incredibly guilty both for the sex outside of marriage and that I’m part of his congregation. He apologized and said it was extremely inappropriate of him. To me it wasn’t a big deal. I told him if he doesn’t want to do it again then we won’t and that I won’t tell anyone.

I didn’t think it was a big deal personally but I knew his beliefs on it and I feel guilty for coming onto him anyway. He clearly is conflicted about it.

"I'd known Qi for 8+ years. Had a lot of common interests and would meet up often (we live 2+hrs from each other). Qi helped me a lot with my career, and I provided Qi with emotional support as they had difficulties.

Qi was in a relationship with someone for 5 years, but it turned sour and eventually, they broke up. Qi said they had romantic feelings for me, and I also had feelings for them but didn't want to say it so soon after their breakup. Eventually, I confessed my feelings and after that Qi and I, at times, got close; it was intimate but not physical per se. Qi went a bit cold on me and said they didn't want a LDR. I was hurt but accepted it. We spoke very infrequently.

Later on, I moved to the same area as Qi for educational reasons. They wanted to meet up but I kept avoiding it as it took me time to bury the feelings. Eventually, we met up and it was just like old times: conversations were flowing. I wanted to meet up again, but this time Qi was quite despondent and wasn't talking much. They left quickly because they were meeting someone else later. I was annoyed as I felt like Qi used me to kill time. Things happened and we stopped talking for 4 months, but then started resuming and all seemed good. I had intentions to propose to Qi. Every time I wanted to meet up, something kept getting in the way, but I wasn't too fussed as I felt there was time.

To keep a long story short, Qi got engaged several months ago which blindsided me. I only found out via a 3rd party who put pictures up on IG of Qi's engagement party. Qi and I had a phone call and I asked them if they were getting married to which they said yes. They then said 'Why do you ask this? What would you have done if I wasn't getting married?"". I refrained from saying anything as I felt it would have been inappropriate. I said ""I'm surprised you haven't blocked me"". Qi replied ""I see no reason for that. I want a plutonic relationship with you"". This confused me given our history. A couple of days after the phone call, I sent Qi a long text basically stating that I had intentions of proposing to them (bad on my part) and Qi didn't need to reply, I just wanted to get my feelings out. Few days later they got married. I wanted to be happy for them, but I was left confused. All this time we were talking to each other and at no point did Qi say they had a partner or fiancée.

A couple of months went by, and Qi replied to my text apologising for not replying as they didn't know what to say and then asked if I was okay. This triggered me and led to do something bad, exposed personal secrets about Qi to their close family members, in-laws, and their partner. Happened a couple of months ago.

Had a lot of common interests and would meet up often (we live 2+hrs from each other). Qi helped me a lot with my career, and I provided Qi with emotional support as they had difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qi was in a relationship with someone for 5 years, but it turned sour and eventually, they broke up. Qi said they had romantic feelings for me, and I also had feelings for them but didn&amp;#39;t want to say it so soon after their breakup. Eventually, I confessed my feelings and after that Qi and I, at times, got close; it was intimate but not physical per se. Qi went a bit cold on me and said they didn&amp;#39;t want a LDR. I was hurt but accepted it. We spoke very infrequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I moved to the same area as Qi for educational reasons. They wanted to meet up but I kept avoiding it as it took me time to bury the feelings. Eventually, we met up and it was just like old times: conversations were flowing. I wanted to meet up again, but this time Qi was quite despondent and wasn&amp;#39;t talking much. They left quickly because they were meeting someone else later. I was annoyed as I felt like Qi used me to kill time.

"I(24F) work as a donut decorator and my partner for the day John(24M) packs the donuts for me. 

Friday was really a long day we had a huge production and currently the only station out of two falling just a tad bit behind. We were almost finished packing the midget donuts, I told John we should pack a certain set of donuts and he listened and right as we were almost finished with that I noticed we had racks of special order donuts to pack. I got upset and told John it is his Job to inform me if those donuts are ready because we are wasting time. John looked at me confused and told me to stop finding ways to blame him for things because nobody else behaves like me in the bakery. he did tell me he did notice the special order but I insisted we pack something else I went back to stirring icing but I did let out it's his fault we are falling behind, John told me to stop because behaving petty is not going to help but I kept going to the point he got upset and threw a donut in my face before storming out of the bakery. 

I would admit I was in shock so I told the manager John slapped me but another co-worker(21F) saw the whole thing and defended John. the manager went around asking questions If John was okay when he came to work but everyone told her he was fine but I probably provoked him because I am very nasty to work with. 

Unfortunately John got fired on the spot and was sent home by HR since the company policy was if anything hit someone either by accident or literal you are fired.

"Now, this co-worker is a shining star. Gets along with everyone, very charming. I like them myself aside from what I am about to discuss further. So, they always go the extra mile in helping everyone out. I like this of them. They make everyone laugh, smile, etc. make them feel welcomed, but one thing that alarms me is the conversational topics they’ve been bringing up with me. 

These topics always, always relate to what I’ve been doing outside of work. Over the weekend I was On the beach. When I came back to work they asked me if I like going to the beach. I post art photographs online, one day they asked me whati think of this  arty photograph they took of a mountain. I recently put a new TAZ (looney tunes) bumper sticker on my car and the next day they come to work with a tweety bird shirt. 

I politely asked them if they’ve looked me up online or have seen me outside of work, but they denied it. I don’t want to accuse someone of an abhorrent mentally fucked up behavior and tarnish a good work relationship. 

It’s making me uncomfortable though. 

I ate 4 biscuits for dinner today on my lunch (I eat out and alone away from the workplace) and when I returned to work they were talking to another worker about their grandma’s famous thanksgiving biscuits.

I don’t get the impression they want to hurt me or ever pick up any sexual advances from them, but this shit is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-N-A-S bananas!! Too many coincidences adding up.

She said she wants attention and isn't asking for much and I just repeat that she'll get my attention when I'm done. It's not like I never give her any attention, we have a date most weekends, regular movie and games nights, go for a drink every now and then during the week etc.  
  
She just stood next to me for me to be finished and I just told her she was acting like a child and she should be able to wait 15 mins.

"New account because Bf(26M) follows my(28F) main. 

Last year when my Bf started working at his current Job, after a month he told me, that his co-workers were constantly making fun of him for being a virgin at the age of 25. I on the other hand prefer to remain a virgin until I am married and my bf has come to accept this. when my Bf told me about what his co-workers were making fun of him for, I got furious and blocked him for a week because it felt like they were insulting me too. 

A year passed since then and I had forgotten all about the ordeal until I was invited to an office party with my Bf. the night was going swell and everyone seemed so nice until I mentioned we have been dating for 4 years, everyone started to laugh and some said ""You didn't leave her yet?"" I felt embarrassed and thought my bf was sharing some bad stories about me, My bf tried to talk them down but they kept on going and going so I left the area and went to the kitchen I would hear so many negative comments such as ""She is probably cheating on him no way she can wait that long"", ""Had three Bfs her entire life and two cheated on her while the third is enduring it, wow but she hates all men for her own decision"" I realized then that they were all making fun of me for my choice to remain pure until marriage

I got upset and asked my bf why doesn't he defend me against his co-workers and all he could tell me is he tries but no matter what he says get's ignored, I felt so heart broken I didn't even want to speak to him until we got home, but his co-workers keep going on and on telling him he should dump or cheat on me but bf keeps telling them the same thing ""If I struggle to get one girl to love me back what makes you think I can do it again!"" but they still won't shut up.

" I have worked in my current job for just over a year and 2 months ago I got rotated to a new team. My old team didn't really interact much. We all got on well but they all enjoyed working from home and we didn't have any social events or anything like that.

My new team likes to meet in the office once a week minimum where we will all go for lunch together, they like to organise social events etc. I really like my new team and it's nice to have a more social aspect to work. The social events tend to be every 3-4 weeks and are things just like going for drinks, going for a meal, bowling etc.

They're really fun and it's been nice for me to get to know my team better. My team is made up of primarily women. There are 2 men, one of them being me and there's another who is a single dad so has only managed to come to 1 of the social events so far.

There is 4 women, 2 of them are quite old, 1 of them is about 8-10 years older than me and 1 is quite close to my age. My partner said she doesn't like the fact I'm spending a lot of time drinking and going out with other women. I told her they're my colleagues and it's nice to get to know them. She just said she doesn't think I should be spending that much time out of work with women.

I told her I'm not going to stop going on social events because she isn't happy my team are mainly women.

"So yesterday, my friend, let's call her Annabelle, is a burnt-out IB student, with strict, toxic asian parents. I can relate to this, because Im in the same situation as her, except Im not mentally ill like she may be.

I've been told by many of her other friends that she hears screaming in her head sometimes, and that it's really concerning. Of course, I was extremely concerned as well, and decided to ask her about it over text, because by the time I received this information, we've already gone home for the weekend.

She's never a serious person(like ever), so she said ""Can we like""""Not talk about this"", and I assumed that she was being sarcastic/funny, like she usually is, which I know, is my fault. So, I jokingly said, ""Haha, No."" She repeated it again, and I told her that I was worried about her, however after that, she never responded after I texted her multiple times, and my messaging app doesn't say if the person read my texts or not.

I consulted another friend(Sarah) who is aware of their situation, and they said that I was at fault, and I should just wait, instead of getting anxious. Sarah got mad at me when I expressed that I found it difficult to keep up with complicated social situations, and how I hated this feeling. I definitely feel like the asshole here, and Im just anxious about Annabelle's mental and physical health, as well as if she's mad at me or not for this.

Im posting this just so that I can get conformation on my position here. I just hope that everything is going to turn out ok, and that Im really just overthinking this.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:

I reached out to both Annabelle and Sarah(separately). I told Sarah that I shouldn't have exploded on her like that about how I felt, and she agreed with me, stating that everyone has these moments, and that I should just let Annabelle take her time. Annabelle has been lively in the gc, but does not respond to me.

I told Sarah that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have exploded on her like that about how I felt, and she agreed with me, stating that everyone has these moments, and that I should just let Annabelle take her time. Annabelle has been lively in the gc, but does not respond to me. I told Annabelle that I am sorry for bringing up a topic she was uncomfortable with, and that when she&amp;#39;s not upset with me, she should reach out, and Ill leave it there.&lt;/p&gt;

"im 19 and my best friend missy 18 had moved in together earlier this year accompanied by her boyfriend evan 20. we had been friends three years prior.

her dads health has been on decline since he’s about 76 and she would be living alone since she was an only child, missy decided to ask evan and i if we wanted to make the move with her. we were hesitant at first seeing as we would be moving almost 50 minutes away from friends and family but eventually agreed seeing as she wanted to take care of her dad. so we moved into her elderly dads house signing contracts and having rent to pay, we all agreed on it and were comfortable with this decision.
 
evan and i both work, missy is unemployed. which we were fine with her being unemployed because she didn’t have to pay anyways but since evan and i are barely home we expected her to do some cleaning in exchange for us working and buying food that she eats as well, she did not clean. cool, now i have to come home from a long day and clean up the two floor house that i share with two other people. 

she begins hanging out with one of evans friends while the two of us are working, nothing weird with that at first, but she starts facetiming him and texting him more regularly i start to pick up on everything. she starts a flirty relationship with said friend.

evan started spending a couple nights at his parents instead of coming home. on nights that he isn’t there he questions me about the happenings at the house, i began covering for her because she is my best friend, i’m even making fabricated pictures of his friend on the couch when she has him over so that he doesn’t know they’re sleeping in the same bed, this goes on for about a week until evan just doesn’t come home at all.

missy decides to break down to me one night that she knows what shes doing is wrong but she want to keep them both for different reasons, i immediately tune her out and nod along because i cannot take this anymore, im in the middle of a mental warfare and two people i love and care about. she continues her sob story i hug her and i go on about my night.

eventually she starts staying at her boy toys place more than usual and since evan basically moved out i’m by myself and not sober about 80% of the time. since my best friend has replaced me with her toy, i decided to come clean to evan about everything i know. he obviously is hurt and breaks down, tells me that he had an idea about it since hes not stupid, we both apologize for not speaking to each other and all is good. i end up quitting what i was on and go sober, evan supports me and he thinks about what to do with his information. he decides a couple days later to text missy about what he knows and she wasn’t happy. missy decides to flip out on evan after he confronts her about everything and breaks up with her, i snap at her and let her know how i’ve felt.

am i the buttface for covering her then turning around and snitching about her affair?

"So I was using the bathroom at school and a friend (let's call him T) from a friend group I'm in walked in the bathroom and recognized me from my shoes in the stall. T started joking on me that I was taking a shit at school which isn't to bad. But what made me report T was that he took his phone and put it over the stall and was recording or taking photos of me being naked. (I was standing up after taking a dump so I was fully exposed) He has sent videos and photos around of people crying and getting hurt without a care in the world so I didn't want that to happen to me. I reported him to the front office and he had his phone confiscated and has a parent conference on Monday also he might not walk the stage.

"I live in the UK with my partner and for most bills we pay 50/50. There are some exceptions for example if one of us wants something that the other person doesn't then that person pays so I pay monthly for a wi-fi booster and some streaming services that my gf uses but doesn't necessarily need.

As it's getting colder we've started using the heating more often. I barely use it since I'm not too cold but my gf has started putting it on for most of the day. I'll be sat in the apartment too hot and uncomfortable asking to turn it off or down but she'll refuse and if it gets turned down she'll just turn it back up. If it was up to me we'd have used it maybe 2 hours a day but my gf has it on for 10-12 hours most days. She puts the heating on to 25C whereas I would be happy with it at 20C.

We pay what we use for our utilities instead of a set direct debit and we got the bill this month and it was over £65 more than usual due to the heating. I showed the bill to my gf and she said there's nothing we could have done to get it lower. I told her I didn't really want to be paying the extra since it's only her using it and she's the one who refuses to consider turning it off when I ask.

She disagreed and said we should be splitting it since we're both benefitting but I pointed out it's not a benefit for me because I'm too hot and don't actually want it on. She said we're supposed to be a team but I just mentioned that if that was true she'd listen to me when I mention turning it off or turning it down but she only wants to have things her way.

She said I was being unreasonable and should pay my half but I don't think I should.

"I live with my partner and we split chores 50/50. When it comes to doing the dishes we do it alternate days so I do one day and she does the next etc. Last night was my gfs da to do it. She was out ot see family and when she got back she asked if I would do it instead since she was tired. I pointed out I was also tired and didn't really want to spend time doing the dishes.

She just kept going on about how tired she was and I just said fine I'll do it. There were still things on the drying rack so I asked if she would put them away for me. She said she didn't like my tone. I just mentioned that I was doing her a favour and am just asking her to do one little thing. She said I was shouting at her which wasn't true, I didn't raise my voice.

She refused to help and said I was being rude to her. Once I was finished she started giving me the silent treatment and then after about an hour she said she wants an apology for how I spoke to her. She said I was shouting and being rude to her. I just said I wasn't going to apologise when all I did was ask her to do one little thing. She just kept repeating that I was shouting at her and being angry towards her.

I just mentioned she's trying to gaslight me since none of that actually happened and she's making an argument out of nothing all because I didn't agree to do the dishes instantly when she couldn't be bothered. She got annoyed and said she wasn't gaslighting me and that I was shouting at her. I just repeated that I didn't raise my voice at all, she just got annoyed at being asked to do something.

She said that I was being cruel and that all she did was ask for help and I'm just using it as an excuse to shout at her and wrongly accuse her of gaslighting.

"Background:  Beth, Mandy and I (34/f) were all best friends. This year I ended my  friendship with Beth. It was really hard but it was something I needed  to do because her words and actions have really been hurtful and her  behavior was getting worse. Mandy is aware of how I feel because she  asked me about it. She even tried encouraging me to talk it out with  Beth and I told Mandy I already had closure and I had no interest in  speaking to Beth again.

Mandy  invited me and my sister to her birthday dinner. When we showed up I was  shocked to see Beth was there. There are some things I can tolerate but  a 2-hour dinner with Beth being one of the 4 people there is not one of  them. I gave Mandy her birthday gifts and told her I could not be  staying for dinner.  Then I walked out.

Mandy  chased after me exclaiming why was I leaving and begged me to stay. I  told her I would not be dining with Beth as she makes me uncomfortable. I  told Mandy we can do something separate for her birthday at another  time. Mandy was visibly upset as my sister and I left.

Afterwards  my sister told me I shouldn’t have done that and that I “obviously”  should have known Beth would be there. Well it is on me for assuming  Mandy would not invite her. I was just flabbergasted she would think it  is a good idea. This wasn’t a birthday party, it was an intimate dinner  of four people. It would have been awful- the tension between Beth and I  and my sister’s mean streak comes out when she drinks. Mandy knows  this. It would have been a disaster and I decided to simply remove us  from a bad situation.

So those  were my justifications for leaving. I want nothing to do with Beth  although I am aware it is Mandy’s choice to invite whoever she likes to  her birthday dinner.

"I(18F) and my boyfriend(20m) and I got into an argument after I told him I was pregnant. I thought he would be happy, as he's been telling me he wanted a baby and forcing me to get off my birth control, but the first thing he had to say was ""you're getting an abortion right?"" I was really confused and hurt because he has been telling me for months that he wanted me to get pregnant. It turns out its a kink of his. I told him I wasnt sure yet and he immediately got really angry. I dont want to go into details of what happened, but it ended up causing a stress-induced miscarriage. Im devastated right now, as this has all happened within the last couple of days. He doesnt know I've had a miscarriage, I dont know if I feel comfortable telling him that. He's still very angry and is telling me that I'm going to throw away our whole relationship over a clump of cells (as I was in my first month of pregnancy). Im still not sure how I fell right now because Im in a lot of emotional pain, but Im starting to think he's right. I love   him and for the most part our relationship has been great. Ive suffered through a lot of abuse and grooming as a child and teenager and I finally felt like I was actually loved. Im not sure what to do now, as I have no friends to talk to, nor any family. Since I've already miscarried I feel like I should apologize and tell him I got an abortion.

\*Edit\* I didnt think anyone saw my other post, and I know it looks really sus about chaging the ages. The truth is, I'm 17. I didnt want to say that because I was afraid I would get a lot of hate.

Im still not sure how I fell right now because Im in a lot of emotional pain, but Im starting to think he&amp;#39;s right. I love   him and for the most part our relationship has been great. Ive suffered through a lot of abuse and grooming as a child and teenager and I finally felt like I was actually loved. Im not sure what to do now, as I have no friends to talk to, nor any family. Since I&amp;#39;ve already miscarried I feel like I should apologize and tell him I got an abortion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Edit* I didnt think anyone saw my other post, and I know it looks really sus about chaging the ages. The truth is, I&amp;#39;m 17. I didnt want to say that because I was afraid I would get a lot of hate. I wanted people to focus on what happened, not the fact that I&amp;#39;m underage. My boyfriend is 20.&lt;/p&gt;

"We’re 22. I’ve been dating my gf, Eva, on-off for 4 years at this point.

The  problem is that Eva has a lot of mental health struggles. She has been  through so much in her life. Whatever you are imaging, it worse.

We’re  pretty broke with no support from our families, so it makes getting  therapy difficult. She has a lot of mental illness. I’m working hard to  get her the help she needs, but it is difficult because we’re both in  college.

Words  cannot describe how much I love this girl. She is the first thing I  think about when I wake up, and the last thing I think about before I go  to sleep. She is everything. I’ve never felt this way about anyone  else.

I’ve  dated other people, but nothing compares. It feels like what I’d  imagine meeting your soulmate would feel like. I want nothing else than  to make her as happy as possible.

It  was obvious she had abandonment issues, and she was terrified of people  leaving her. She never let anyone else in for the reason. She has BPD.

I  know she loves me, but she has broken up with me 11 times. I’ve  counted. She’s terrified I’m going to leave, so she finds excuses to  break up with me to save herself the heartbreak. I told her I’d stay  forever so many times, but she doesn’t believe it.

I’ve  been hurt more than I thought I could ever be hurt. It’s painful,  getting broken up with over &amp; over. I always tell her that I’m here  for her, and I’m not leaving. It should be obvious at this point that  I’m here to stay, but she can’t believe it. She said if we broke up for  certain, she’d never date anyone else again. I believe her.

Today,  we were eating dinner with my bff. He mentioned that he wanted to try a  threesome with his girl because “every guy alive wants a threesome.”

This  annoyed my gf who immediately turned to me and said, “Every guy, huh? I  guess that means you.” I tried to talk here out of it, but she told me  if I wanted to fuck someone else I was welcome to do it bc I was single  now.

She  left. I followed her to the car and told her I loved her, I have no  interest in ever sleeping with someone else, a hot woman could be naked  in my lap and I would have 0 interest. I only want her, I’ve only ever  wanted her. But she said she didn’t believe me and that was that.

I  was in the parking lot, heartbroken, when my bff said sorry dude, but  it’s for the best. I was angry at the implication and yelled at him. I  said this was his fault, he said “all men want threesomes” implying I  wanted to sleep with another girl, he ruined it.

He said no, your psychotic gf ruined it. She sucks.

I  yelled at him more. I said “she’s not psychotic, you jerk, she’s  fucking mentally ill. I don’t want to speak to someone who talks about  my GF like that.”

He  said “are you insane? We’ve been friends for our entire lives. Holy  shit, dude. You can blame me all you want, but your psychotic gf is the  issue. Not me for making a harmless comment.”

I ended up leaving, but I’ve felt bad since. He is a good friend to me.

Thank you to everyone who commented! 

It’s been over a year now and I thought I’d make an update. All contact has been cut from him on my side, however I still get calls and messages from random numbers that end up being him. He’s tried to get back with me, then it turned to him telling me about all these girls he’s been with and how much he loves them. It’s been a while since he last tried to contact me, and I’m hoping that he’ll finally leave me alone. 
I’m in a good, stable, HEALTHY relationship now. My partner is amazing and treats me with so much respect. I ended my therapy a couple months ago as advised by my therapist (she said that I was able to handle myself and didn’t need her, but if I ever did need her again I was more than welcome to contact her).

"I am friends with a girl who just broke up with her boyfriend, and she confided in me for emotional support. She told me that in the days leading up to the breakup, he started becoming jealous and possessive of her, and accused her of having feelings for a mutual friend. You know, typical high school level kind of drama.

She showed me a bunch of screenshots of text interactions between them as well as a discreetly recorded video of them talking. In the video, he was accusing her of emotionally cheating on him, and that she should do research on what it means. He just dismissed her like that and emotionally abused her.

I think the ex was definitely full of shit. If you accuse somebody of something and then tell them to go research it instead of elaborating and giving them your full perspective, that just means you don't know what the hell you're talking about if you can't explain it to them yourself. 

So the other day I ran into him and told him that I heard about everything, and that I told him calmly but fiercely: ""If you ever go near her or hurt her in any way, I will beat you into the ground."" 

Now, I wasn't afraid of him because he is actually a pretty skinny and lanky guy. By contrast, I have more muscle mass than him and could definitely wreck him in a fight. He has way more bark than bite and he really has no effective intimidation factor.

"I 16M dated a guy for about a year. We will call him Josh. During our freshman year we were both part of tech theater. Our schools theater club does a show called Fresh Face which is a collection of short plays that new people in theater can help out on. We were part of the props team together and I had so much fun. I met people I cherish and had a lot of fun dipping my toes in this type of production because it is where I want to head career wise.

Sadly, the week before opening night, my mom got Covid. This was extremely scary due to the fact she has asthma and was at the risk of being hospitalized. My families entire weekly routine was off track. My dad was trying his best being parent 1 when it comes to school (my mom works at my highschool so she usually handles this kind of stuff) and that entire week was extremely stressful for all of us. I sadly couldn't do the play anymore because I had missed too many rehersals. When I told Josh this he seemed sorta annoyed that I would be missing tech week and no matter how much I tried to explain it was because I had to quarantine he just brushed it off.

It was now opening night and I decided to see if I could try and make it to the show. I had taken 2 tests that were negative, so did my dad, so we were planning on going. I excitedly told Josh that I would be there to support him and everyone else's hard work. He blew up.

He started to call me selfish and an idiot for even wanting to. That it was careless of me. I kept trying to tell him that I was negative, would be wearing a mask, and would be sitting in a row that only has two seats so we would be far away from everyone. He didn't care and just continued to call me selfish and careless. He even began to insult my dad saying he was acting idiotic and evil for even supporting my selfish behavior. I told him I wouldn't go but he even got more upset with that. So after a lot of debating I finally just told my dad to drop me off and pick me up in an hour. I remember crying in the theater and running out right as it ended.

We broke up a couple weeks after this fight and I still think about it. I still don't know who's in the wrong. I've always said we both were, but my friends and family have said that Josh was the only one in the wrong so I truly don't know what to believe. So am I the buttface?

Edit: My quarantine time was up which is why I thought going with precautions would be ok.

"Hey Reddit, I’m using a throwaway account since this is a messy situation and I need some outside perspective. So, I (17M) recently found myself in a situation that spiraled way out of control, and I'm not sure if I'm the bad guy or if I'm just caught up in a web of lies. Here's the deal:

A while back, I had this classmate (17M), who I’ll refer to as “C”. C had a reputation for being troubled and he passed away unexpectedly. Due to a misunderstanding, his family believed we were close friends, when in reality, we barely knew each other. In a moment of desperation and not wanting to hurt them, I decided to play along and pretend that C and I were best friends.

Fast forward, things got crazy. The lie escalated, and I even fabricated a series of letters to and from C to make it look like we were really tight. It all went south when those letters were discovered, and now I'm in the middle of this huge mess.

The thing is, I never meant for any of this to happen. I was just trying to help C’s family through a tough time, but I've hurt a lot of people in the process. I should have come clean from the start, but now it feels impossible to untangle this web of lies.

So, Reddit, am I the jerk here? AITB for pretending to be friends with a deceased classmate to ease his family's pain, even if it ended up causing more harm than good? I'm genuinely torn and not sure how to fix things.

"Hello, my relationship with my girlfriend of 4 months ended a few weeks back, mainly due to quite a few disagreements that we couldn't agree on, so decided it was best to end it. There was one particular argument we would go back and forth on which I'm struggling to come to grips with and I wanted some second opinions. I feel my feelings in this situation were warranted, I'm very open to constructive criticism and would like some advice if I was in the wrong:

So it was a Wednesday night where I had two very bad sleeps the two nights prior, so I was quite tired on the Wednesday. We hung out together on the Tuesday night and she slept over mine, and then we spent Wednesday morning together before she went home. I was laying in bed Wednesday night and we were just chit chat texting, when she asked if I could come over. As much as I would have liked to, I told her I'm about to go to sleep as I was really tired since I didn't sleep well the past 2 days (I also had work the next day). She got upset that I didn't come over and in her mind she thought i didn't want to see her, which wasn't the case at all, which I explained to her, and then I told her I was just exhausted from the lack of sleep and needed a good sleep before work the next day. I then got a bit upset as I felt she was questioning how much I liked her and my commitment to seeing her, while I felt she wasn't taking in account my feelings and being tired. Her argument was that I'm a guy and I just need 4 clothing items, all I had to do was pack it in my bag and drive to hers, and that if I liked her that much it wouldn't be a problem.

Was I in the wrong here? From her perspective, she felt that I wasn't showing her how much I liked and wanted her. I'm someone who is very open with understanding other peoples emotions and feelings, but I felt in this situation my feelings were not being accounted for. We have argued about this quite a few times, and when I broke up with her and I brought it up again, she said ""what do you want me to just say, okay have a good sleep?!?!""

EDIT: What made this even more confusing for me was a contradicting situation that occurred probably 3 weeks after this. One night I visited her late at night around 10:30pm and surprised her with flowers, then we were just hanging out in her room when I said I could sleep over tonight and then go to my grandpas house when I wake up in the morning (had arranged to go visit him and mow their grass), but to this she said no because she wants to get a good sleep herself before a birthday party she had in the morning and wanted time to get ready etc. I understood her, and left her house shortly after so she can sleep.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-30T04:32:40.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, my relationship with my girlfriend of 4 months ended a few weeks back, mainly due to quite a few disagreements that we couldn&amp;#39;t agree on, so decided it was best to end it. There was one particular argument we would go back and forth on which I&amp;#39;m struggling to come to grips with and I wanted some second opinions. I feel my feelings in this situation were warranted, I&amp;#39;m very open to constructive criticism and would like some advice if I was in the wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was a Wednesday night where I had two very bad sleeps the two nights prior, so I was quite tired on the Wednesday. We hung out together on the Tuesday night and she slept over mine, and then we spent Wednesday morning together before she went home. I was laying in bed Wednesday night and we were just chit chat texting, when she asked if I could come over. As much as I would have liked to, I told her I&amp;#39;m about to go to sleep as I was really tired since I didn&amp;#39;t sleep well the past 2 days (I also had work the next day). She got upset that I didn&amp;#39;t come over and in her mind she thought i didn&amp;#39;t want to see her, which wasn&amp;#39;t the case at all, which I explained to her, and then I told her I was just exhausted from the lack of sleep and needed a good sleep before work the next day. I then got a bit upset as I felt she was questioning how much I liked her and my commitment to seeing her, while I felt she wasn&amp;#39;t taking in account my feelings and being tired. Her argument was that I&amp;#39;m a guy and I just need 4 clothing items, all I had to do was pack it in my bag and drive to hers, and that if I liked her that much it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was I in the wrong here? From her perspective, she felt that I wasn&amp;#39;t showing her how much I liked and wanted her. I&amp;#39;m someone who is very open with understanding other peoples emotions and feelings, but I felt in this situation my feelings were not being accounted for. We have argued about this quite a few times, and when I broke up with her and I brought it up again, she said &amp;quot;what do you want me to just say, okay have a good sleep?!?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

"I'm going to be a bit vague on personal details (age, gender identity, etc) for my own comfortability and to protect the identity all parties involved.

A bit of history to start with. My cousin and I have always had a bit of a strained relationship. I'm older by a few years, and they've always been a bit of a jerk to me; it escalated when we were teens and they became nearly unbearable to be around. There would be family vacations where they'd be there, and they'd pick at me and pick at me until I'd finally retaliate. 
Now, I'm a person with a lot of patience. I'm a pretty chill person and it takes a lot to rial me up. But they managed to do it often, typically by being a jerk consistently. 
I'm also going to note that I know that teens in general teens just suck, and that I was/am in no way perfect. I may have inadvertently caused some issues then as well, and just don't remember/didn't realize at the time. 


When I'd retaliate, they'd go to their mother because ""OP did this to me!"" To which then (again, because I was older and bigger) I'd get a lecture about how we were family and I should put up with it. 

Cut to 20ish years later, and they and I have gone for the most part mutually no contact. We see each other during the occasional holiday (Christmas, Thanksgiving).
Anyway, I hadn't seen them or heard from them for several months. We'd parted on good terms, but still we remained on a low/no contact situation. 

Cut to last week when I got a message from them on IG. They sent me a link to a website calling for the resignation of our current political leader. I'm no fan of the person in power, but I also have a hard line when it comes to people sending me political propaganda. It's a line I've had to draw with many people, including my grandparents and father. 
I replied back ""I'm not opening this, and if you keep sending politics I'll block you.""
They blew up at me, called me a few names and said my head was up my ass. They said because I don't have kids I don't understand the problems the country faces and so on. 
He then insulted my family, which prompted me to send the messages to my folks. Mum is on my side, though she did tell me that my response was a bit agressive. 
Looking back at it, I agree my message was agressive. But I also know that if I don't draw a hard line my wishes won't be respected. In my experience, family members obsessed with politics rarely respect boundaries unless a hard line is drawn. 

So, am I the asshole for being so blunt and agressive with my reply? Mostly I'm just worried about the unintended waves this will cause between family members.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-29T19:44:24.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to be a bit vague on personal details (age, gender identity, etc) for my own comfortability and to protect the identity all parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;

"I(17) met a person that liked me, they  (19)  told me they wanted to have a  relationship with someone a month after we met. I told them Id rather wait for a while since we only met a month ago and  Ive never been so close to someone ever before so I wanted to see what  its like.

We start getting close and we start being more comfortable and sharing our lives with each other with some hugs along the way, of course.

Then the kicker, I recently realize im just happy to be so close to  someone and not actually interested in a relationship with them. Ive never had close friends since I was a kid so I got happy I finally  did and it seemed like I made them think was already decided on that I  was interested in a relationship, even thought I never said that, I just  wanted some love from close friends.

In fact, Ive tried to remind them that we are currently not in a  relationship and we are in a state of testing things out by calling them  my close friend, sometimes they say something like ""you are still with  that friends thing??"" and im like ""yes???"" because I didnt want them to  think we are dating, I wanted them to think that I was deciding it, not  that I already made up my mind.

When Ive made up my mind I tell them that I dont feel interested in a relationship and I want to  stay as close friends. They take it well but later on I say that it always happens to me that I lose interest in someone whenever I get close to them (as in I dont want to date them and would very much rather stay close friends)  They interpreted it wrong and thought I wasnt interested in THEM anymore, I apologised to them immediately but they since they got hurt by that they left.

Overall, They were kind of pushy about getting me to date them and they kinda get offended with ease.

As you may have noticed from this post Im prone to saying things with the wrong words that hurt people. Im also very  scatterbrained like I forget a lot of things and I dont really pay  attention.

"I visited my favorite bar after a long day of work last night. It’s usually empty, but yesterday had an obscene amount of early twenties hipsters. 

It didn’t deter me from going to another watering hole though. I ordered my lager and nested into my favorite spot. 10 minutes in this group walks up to me.

“Bro! Bro.. We love your beard. Can I take a selfie with you?”

One of them takes a selfie with me before I can reject.

 “Ahh, man, I’d prefer not. Shit.”

He then points to his buddy and asks him to take a photo of us. I’m not having it, but don’t want to leave my spot.

He says, “Bro, you smell amazing. What *is* that cologne? Chicks LOVE that shit I bet.”

This is when I figured he was being a petty fuck. Not some unusual extrovert. I *knew* I smelled, but not that much. Enough to attract confrontation. 

I say, “Hey, I’m just here for a beer. Can you leave me alone?”

“Yeah, yeah for sure bro. But yo, take a fucking shower before you step into this bar next time. You smell like a moldy ass towel. Creep.”

"I entered my building through the freight entrance. The building porter (who makes me really uncomfortable whenever I see him, it is just a vibe) was breaking down some boxes. I was so relieved that I didn't have to wait for the elevator because as soon as I pressed the up button the doors opened right away.

I got on, and I felt the guy staring at me. I felt uncomfortable and he could see the button panel so I pressed a different button for my floor. I decided once doors closed I would press my actual floor (he wouldn't be able to tell because there is no elevator display down there).

But...then he got on. And he pressed the button for the basement. So he was going to ride with me up 6 floors just to go back down.

I do not understand this logic. I have seen people running on because they are not paying attention and accidentally take elevator up when they wanted to go down but this guy clearly saw I was going up and he still got on with me.

"I (F52) moved across country back in the spring. I had an inheritance that allowed me to purchase a home that needed some work and I planned on fixing it up over some time and spending my retirement years in this new town. To start making some connections in the community, I volunteered at a few places. One of those was the local library. I show up to do some readings to kids sometimes, and other times I help with sales of library books and set up for teen game nights. I get to meet plenty of people in a large age range this way. 

One of the girls I volunteer with recommended a couple of local groups online and I thought that was a great idea. I made some connections through these groups but there was one woman, we'll call her ""Bri"" (F52), that I thought was really interesting and I enjoyed talking to. 

Bri and I spent a lot of time texting before we met up and when we met up, it was like we'd known each other forever. One of Bri's life stories was about an ex of hers. Someone who had taken advantage of her, even though she's a low-wage earner, and had gotten her convinced that her chronic pain could only be relieved by smoking weed so a good portion of her already meager income was supporting that habit (and his, too). He happened to be in jail at the moment and they had split when he'd been sentenced for some petty theft crime last winter. 

About a month after we began talking, her ex got in touch with her to say that he was being released and wanted to try again with her. To my surprise, she accepted his advances and told me how excited she was to have him home again because she missed him so much. Long story short, I was entirely correct in being worried that his coming home would send her household into a war zone that would lead to even more financial difficulties. I helped a few times with sending takeout to her place when she'd had a terrible day, or sending dog food when I knew she was low and didn't get paid for another week. Then I started getting messages from her asking if I would hire her boyfriend to do work on my house. I declined and then I started getting texts and online messages from unknown numbers and accounts, accusing me of making Bri beg for money and letting her starve. I cut off contact at that point. Bri came to the library when I wasn't there and told the children's director that I was a terrible person and shouldn't be allowed around the children or the teen groups. The director told me what happened and I told her my side of the story and the story got around. Now this small town is still talking about it months later and Bri is sending me text messages accusing me of ""poisoning the well"" when all she wanted was to be a friend and ""get friend rewards"". AITA for telling others about the weird messages that seemed to have come from her partner and about the requests for money and other favors?

Now this small town is still talking about it months later and Bri is sending me text messages accusing me of &amp;quot;poisoning the well&amp;quot; when all she wanted was to be a friend and &amp;quot;get friend rewards&amp;quot;. AITA for telling others about the weird messages that seemed to have come from her partner and about the requests for money and other favors? &lt;/p&gt;

"My (22m) friend (23m) has me really upset tonight.  I'm having such a shit day and I called him at 12am to talk, but as soon as he was done talking about his day and heard I didn't have a good one, he said he had to go to bed.  He never goes to bed that early, normally 2am is when he sleeps from what he tells me and our normal hangouts.  It felt like he just left because I was sad.  I texted him I'm not doing great, could he talk and he said ""sorry, goodnight"".

It upsets me because last week I stayed up until 9am with him helping finish a project (I didn't do any of the work for him but he wasted company to make sure he didn't pass out becauae it was worth 30% of his grade) and tonight I just wanted any kind of emotion and he slammed the door in my face.

"We are both 30, together for 3 months.

We talked about our plans for yesterday. I am supposed to welcome a friend who is visiting me from abroad and I assumed he would arrive close to midnight. She was going to be in the office and get home at like 6:30PM. I was going to finish work at like 7PM. So I suggested I could visit her (30-40mins by bus) in the evening.

She cooked and said she would try to come home not too late, but since my friend didn't know exactly when he would arrive I said we would play it by the ear. Yesterday morning, however, my recruiter scheduled a call to prepare me for a job interview some time after 7PM since the next day (today) I was having an interview. And also another friend of mine wanted to call because he needed support during his divorce. My friend who was visiting me ended up not taking breaks while driving and he was going to arrive earlier as well.

My girlfriend didn't get upset and told me to ""prioritize what's important for me"" and she wished me good luck at the interview. Today we are meeting for dinner together with my friend who is visiting. I thought we were good.

But my sister says that the fact that I didn't visit her was an AH move. My schedule was tight and I told my gf in advance, but I could have at least prioritized her over the friend who is divorcing. We are still in the beginning and I don't feel the need to be with her all the time, she supports me and I support her, and she would also sometimes leave my place earlier so she could focus on work when needed (ex: she could stay at mine from Thu-Sun, but she sometimes goes home on Fridays because she can concentrate better at home).","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-28T15:37:10.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are both 30, together for 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

"Theo, my best friend, has always been my ride or die, we grew up together and are really close. We're like brothers. He was the only person growing up who was accepting of my sexuality, even though he is 100% straight. He is such a good friend to me and we talk sex all the time.

Ev and I have been dating for 2 years and I love him so much. I know he is my forever person. We live together with my bff and his bff, and we're all inseparable. Basically family.

I know Ev loves my best friend, he said he has started to think of him like a brother.

My bf is very vanilla in bed. I don't say that as a negative. It's cute. I'm into kink/BDSM. When I turned 18 I immediately started going to munches, events, clubs and Theo would come with me.

When I mentioned I'd like to tie Ev up, he freaked out so I never brought it up again. It was clearly not something he was into, which was fine. The sex was still great, no complaints.

My BFF not knowing we don't have that type of relationship gifted Ev a bunch of BDSM-related stuff for his birthday. This isn't weird because we are all very open about sex.

I said I'd talk to Theo later, but Ev said it was fine, we can talk now. He told him that BDSM/the handcuffs weren't his thing. Theo said, ""Well, they are my best friend's thing, so you better suit up, pretty boy, and keep my guy satisfied. If he wants a submissive in bed, make it happen."" Ev got annoyed and said he keeps me plenty satisfied. I said the sex was great, I didn't even need any of that other stuff. But the convo was entertaining so I let it go on.

Theo said well, that sounds great, but I don't want my bff to be missing out on things he wants, and I'm worried he is because this is something I know that he likes. So, if you are the guy for him, time to suit up.

Ev said I just don't know, it's not really my thing. Theo said, ""How do you know? Have you tried it? You should try it before you decide you don't like it.""

Ev said I don't know if I can do that, it would make me feel unsafe and uncomfortable. Theo said you shouldn't feel unsafe/uncomfy, your bf wouldn't let anything bad happen to you. Just give it a shot, keep my boy happy. Ev replied maybe I should give it a try now, tie you up instead, which made me snort.

I told Theo to chill, but said I was flattered he cared so much about me and my happiness. He said of course, friends want friends to have good sex.

My bf said well, clearly he doesn't give a shit about me. I said hey, don't say that, we're family, of course he does. It was obvious he was hurt/upset.

Theo said, ""Hey, now. Don't be upset. I love you, ok."" I said we could return the gift, buy something else with the money, but my bf cut me off and said, ""no, keep it for the next bf."" I was taken aback, even though he wasn't being serious. I wasn't expecting him to be upset at me. Tf did I do? I said there wouldn't be a next boyfriend, I love him, but he ignored me and went to bed.

"# People

Wife — **W**

Brother-in-law — **BIL**

Sister-in-law — **SIL**

Son — **S** (2 year old)

Cousin — **C** (3 year old)

Mother-in-law — **MIL**

Father-in-law — **FIL**

Parents-in-law — **PIL**

# Chain of events

The cousins like each other a lot. But they fight a lot during playtime, as one would expect from little kids.

First we had a meal at the local restaurant to celebrate my **MIL**'s birthday. **S** has a hard time sitting still. When he got bored, I went out to the street with him to kill time. **C** managed to sit in one place for the entire time (the secret sauce was the games on **SIL**'s phone). After eating we went back home for cake/talking/playtime.

For me everything seemed to go okay. Lot of fights, because **S** couldn't deal with **C** playing with his toys. We tried everything to manage a 50-50 split.

They left after a couple of hours. Both kids were exhausted, but **C** didn't want to leave. On Monday **BIL** called **W**. No greetings, no nothing, we were called all kinds of names for messing with **C**. They told us to parent **S**, and they swore to never meet us and his parents ever again.

# Their problems

Not the full list:

* We favored our kid over theirs and even took the toys away from him every chance given.
* When **C** rode the little bike inside, we blocked his way. (He even drove through **S** once, just to keep going).
* We said mean things: ""Everything here belongs to **S**"" (this was sarcasm, we didn't mean it). ""**S** can color **C**'s colorbook too."" (I said unintentionally this one in a way that it sounded like **S** can color as well as **C**).
* ""All around **C** wasn't allowed to do anything, while **S** got all the fun.""
* **BIL** doesn't like me, because ""I am a PhD, who can't even lift a straw up"", and I never help **FIL** (I help him as much as he does, according to my wife even more).
* I often say to them similar hurtful stuff. (Definitely unintentional if true).
* It bothered them, that **S** couldn't sit still for an hour.
* They find it offensive that we visit the **PIL** weekly. As if we tried to swindle them out of their inheritance or something. Nothing stops them from coming weekly, they live a 30 min drive away, we have to drive for 2 hours.

# Other context

* **MIL** is a retired kindergarten teacher. She has quite a lot of experience with kids, as you can imagine.
* They claim that **C** behaves well, yet these happen all the time: **C** pushes **S** over regularly. **C** hit ME, a grown-ass adult multiple times. **C** also rips his stuff out from **S**'s hand all the time when we visit them. Once he even made **S** cry by yelling at him just for the lols. He even did the naughty laugh afterwards, because this was funny according to him. We never complained to them about these, we kind of expect children this young to do stuff like this. All we can do, is parent them in the process.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-28T08:42:38.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;People&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIL&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t like me, because &amp;quot;I am a PhD, who can&amp;#39;t even lift a straw up&amp;quot;, and I never help &lt;strong&gt;FIL&lt;/strong&gt; (I help him as much as he does, according to my wife even more).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I often say to them similar hurtful stuff. (Definitely unintentional if true).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It bothered them, that &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; couldn&amp;#39;t sit still for an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They find it offensive that we visit the &lt;strong&gt;PIL&lt;/strong&gt; weekly. As if we tried to swindle them out of their inheritance or something. Nothing stops them from coming weekly, they live a 30 min drive away, we have to drive for 2 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Other context&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIL&lt;/strong&gt; is a retired kindergarten teacher. She has quite a lot of experience with kids, as you can imagine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They claim that &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; behaves well, yet these happen all the time: &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; pushes &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; over regularly. &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; hit ME, a grown-ass adult multiple times. &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; also rips his stuff out from &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s hand all the time when we visit them. Once he even made &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt; cry by yelling at him just for the lols. He even did the naughty laugh afterwards, because this was funny according to him. We never complained to them about these, we kind of expect children this young to do stuff like this. All we can do, is parent them in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We had finished the first year of our master's program and gone back to our homes/internship locations for 2.5 months period.

Me and my roommate were obviously hostellers, we had a good relationship if I say so myself for the 10 months we lived as roommates. I really tried my best to be a good roommate. I would hear her out if she had something to rant about and she would do the same. I have even cooked ramen of her when she came back too drunk and wanted to eat something.

However, she was definitely better friends with this girl who lived down the hall and she had told me that she might live out of campus in the coming year and I took the info and rolled with it.

1.5 months into the summer break/internship period we got our hostellers list with paired-up people. The admin decides randomly about the pairs. I was paired with her and I immediately texted her that we were roommates again. To this, she told me she might still live out of campus.

After 10 days we had paid our hostel fee and we got the updated list again. Again I was paired with her. I texted her again asking what happened. She told me that she couldn't find a suitable place to live so she decided to be in a hostel.

I asked about the friend who she wanted to live with and she said ""ya we will still live together, you can live with her roommates. Let's just do an unofficial swap of roommates."". To this, I told her that I didn't wanna live with this other girl as I never agreed to this swap in the first place. (Swapping is also put a target on our backs and the administration can take action as it is against the rules of the campus hostel.).

I knew this girl and she had fights with her previous roommates and she would keep the place a mess and all in all, something I didn't sign up for.

My roommate kept texting me trying to sell me on the idea and going in circles when I had told her that I won't be doing this swap. This text conversation lasted 2 hours and me in tears.

I told her I was done.

5 days later her friend texted me and I just told her that I had already spent enough emotions on this situation when it was not even my problem. I will not be living with this other girl as I never agreed to this in the first place and my roommate and her could live together and I don't have any problem with that!

This ended up with my roommate still being my roommate and them not living together.

AITBF for punching a hole in my older brothers door?

For some background information. My (20yr) brother has no respect for boundaries! I (17yr) have stated multiple times that I don’t want him in my room and that he has to ask, knock, or open my door with a warning before coming in. I set this for multiple reasons considering I’m a growing young lady but he purposely ignores all my boundaries to annoy me. This would be fine if it was a normal amount for a sibling but it’s not. 

Everyday he breaks into my room like shrek opening his outhouse door then proceeds to yell, go through my things, lay in my bed (if I’m not in it), or shoot me with a orbeez gun (which hurts). Everyday I tell him to “get out” and “stop being so loud” and he always says “shut up” and continues to invade my space. 

Recently I’ve started taking birth control again and as a result I’m exhausted. This morning when my parents left he barged in again to ask a question then left, later while I was still trying to sleep he barged in AGAIN but this time pushing the door soo hard (or at least harder than usual) it made me jump out of my sleep. I told him to “get the f**k out” at least three times and when he didn’t and continued to walk in I snapped. I jumped out of bed to push him out but he ran to his room smiling and then closed the door with his back against it laughing. Out of pure rage I punched a hole in it before calming down. Realizing what I did I tried to call my dad to tell him what happened before my brother could call and lie, making it worse. While the phone is ringing he pushes the door open and stands in my room saying “No I won’t get out. You broke my door” so to get him out I had to literally fight him out of my room.

Am I the asshole? I’ve been crying about it all day because I don’t know how else to keep him out. I tell my parents he does this but he doesn’t listen to them either.

"So a few days ago I was at a store with my husband and we started having a minor back and forth while waiting for our food. He raised his voice and started treating me disrespectfully so I told him to lower his voice and stop talking to me like that. He went on a rant about me treating him like a child and if I have a problem to wait until we’re in private to talk about it. Things were settled. Today I did just that. We were at another store and had a budget to stick to. At the register, things went a little over budget (by less than a dollar) and he said out loud “I can’t even get everything I want because of you”. That caused an awkward silence with the cashier and I felt disrespected and felt it was inappropriate to say that in front of people. But I made sure to wait till we were in private to bring it up. Before I mentioned it, he did say he was sorry for getting riled up but I did want to bring out that I dont like when he talks to me like that infront of other people (he never acknowledged that part). So I said it and he denied it, apologized and then after that, got mad and talked about how I’m imagining things and nothing like that ever happened. Stupid me went to state an example of how others have mentioned how he talks to me. He asked “who”. I denied to answer because he has a hard time making friends and I knew he would blow things out of proportion and find a reason to hate whoever’s name I mentioned. Needless to say this was no longer a conversation. I started getting so anxious I begged him to please stop because I felt like I was about to have an anxiety attack. He shut up until I started crying. Apparently me crying is “escalating the situation”. I mumbled to myself “I can’t fricking say anything” but according to him, he heard “you can suck on…”. Like what?!?!?? So now I’m a liar for denying that. And now he’s saying we should rethink our relationship if he’s giving me panic attacks. Huh?!?! I find myself constantly having to bottle things up even though he tells me not to, because what’s the point if he gets mad and defensive when I do? I’d rather shut up and eventually die of a heart attack for keeping things in. So, AITB for sparking this/how this turned out?  

P.S. I don’t need to hear “you should leave him”. I would in a heartbeat if I could. But due to a situation I cannot expose, let’s just say I can only do so under one very specific circumstance. And if that circumstance ever came, I would in a heartbeat.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-28T00:45:34.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a few days ago I was at a store with my husband and we started having a minor back and forth while waiting for our food.

"**EDITED TO ADD -** my dog **didn't** really **jump** on her; she was on the ground and he went to sniff her/""say hi,"" he not jump on a standing person. He's usually very good about not jumping on people, and when he isn't we correct him. I wasn't completely accurate in my description. He most definitely didn't jump on her. **Furthermore,** he was still on a **leash**, we had just came into the house and he was still wearing his harness and still on a leash.

**EDITED 2 TO ADD**  \- when we go to my in-laws for a shorter period of time (lunch, dinner), my dog stays at home. This time we want for the entire day (all of Thanksgiving day), so I wasn't able to leave him at home alone for that long, that's why we brought him with us.

My (41m) SIL (33f) has two sons (an almost 4 years and a 1.5 years old) and lives another state. I live with my wife (36f) in a different state, and her parents live here too. My SIL and family usually come twice to three times a year and came for Thanksgiving this year and stayed for a week (Friday to Friday) with my in-laws

My nephew, her older son (almost 4), is a very active, very high energy, very sensitive child (quick to outburst and have tantrums). He sometimes throws items on people and for some reason I'm one of his favorite targets. He's also afraid of my dog and has pushed him and tried to hit and kick him in the past to get him away from him (I always take my dog away from him so he doesn't hurt him). I've never said anything about the item throwing or what he did to my dog in the past.

We had dinner one evening last week, the kid was more hyper than usual, and during the meal he chucked a pretty heavy plastic toy, pretty hard and I raised my hand in reflex to protect my face and it bounced off of it and to the floor. His parents didn't say anything about it and the meal continued. I got a little annoyed but let it go.

We came to my in-laws house with our dog (who LOVES my FIL) for Thanksgiving dinner, and he ran inside to say hi to grandpa :) He also loves my SIL and wanted to jump on her, but she was on the ground with her son, who pushed my dog, pretty hard, and so my FIL called him and held him. Again, nothing was said or addressed. I probably made a face or something because that really annoyed me.

We sit down to dinner, and then her son threw a napkin ring at me, and I said his name, irritated. And then my SIL goes off about how ""that side of the table (again, me and the FIL) is full of judgement of her son,"" My FIL tried to calm her down and at some point I chime in and say: ""we wouldn't have said anything, if you did or said something when your child was acting out,"" and she got annoyed even more and again said that we're ""judging her child, etc."" At this point I said that ""this is not the 1st, 2nd nor the 3rd time your child throws something at me or pushes or tries to hit my dog, and you didn't say or do anything, let alone apologize,""and she replied ""why should I apologize, I didn't do anything.""

At this point I got really annoyed and said ""what are you waiting for, for your child to really hurt someone? Are you going to wait until he kills my dog to say or do something?!"" At this point my wife tells me to shut up and I realized I may have overdone it. At this point they leave the table and don't come back.My wife says I was way too harsh on them, I think it needed to be said and addressed. AITA?

**TL;DR** \- my SIL and BIL don't do anything when their child acts out (throwing things forcefully at me and pushing or trying to hit or kick my dog - multiple times) and I told them to actually parent their child before he pokes someone's eye out with a toy or kills my dog. AITBF?

He&amp;#39;s also afraid of my dog and has pushed him and tried to hit and kick him in the past to get him away from him (I always take my dog away from him so he doesn&amp;#39;t hurt him). I&amp;#39;ve never said anything about the item throwing or what he did to my dog in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had dinner one evening last week, the kid was more hyper than usual, and during the meal he chucked a pretty heavy plastic toy, pretty hard and I raised my hand in reflex to protect my face and it bounced off of it and to the floor. His parents didn&amp;#39;t say anything about it and the meal continued. I got a little annoyed but let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came to my in-laws house with our dog (who LOVES my FIL) for Thanksgiving dinner, and he ran inside to say hi to grandpa :) He also loves my SIL and wanted to jump on her, but she was on the ground with her son, who pushed my dog, pretty hard, and so my FIL called him and held him. Again, nothing was said or addressed. I probably made a face or something because that really annoyed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sit down to dinner, and then her son threw a napkin ring at me, and I said his name, irritated. And then my SIL goes off about how &amp;quot;that side of the table (again, me and the FIL) is full of judgement of her son,&amp;quot; My FIL tried to calm her down and at some point I chime in and say: &amp;quot;we wouldn&amp;#39;t have said anything, if you did or said something when your child was acting out,&amp;quot; and she got annoyed even more and again said that we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;judging her child, etc.&amp;quot; At this point I said that &amp;quot;this is not the 1st, 2nd nor the 3rd time your child throws something at me or pushes or tries to hit my dog, and you didn&amp;#39;t say or do anything, let alone apologize,&amp;quot;and she replied &amp;quot;why should I apologize, I didn&amp;#39;t do anything.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I got really annoyed and said &amp;quot;what are you waiting for, for your child to really hurt someone? Are you going to wait until he kills my dog to say or do something?!&amp;quot; At this point my wife tells me to shut up and I realized I may have overdone it. At this point they leave the table and don&amp;#39;t come back.My wife says I was way too harsh on them, I think it needed to be said and addressed. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; - my SIL and BIL don&amp;#39;t do anything when their child acts out (throwing things forcefully at me and pushing or trying to hit or kick my dog - multiple times) and I told them to actually parent their child before he pokes someone&amp;#39;s eye out with a toy or kills my dog. AITBF?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDITED TO ADD -&lt;/strong&gt; my dog &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; really &lt;strong&gt;jump&lt;/strong&gt; on her; she was on the ground and he went to sniff her/&amp;quot;say hi,&amp;quot; he not jump on a standing person. He&amp;#39;s usually very good about not jumping on people, and when he isn&amp;#39;t we correct him. I wasn&amp;#39;t completely accurate in my description. He most definitely didn&amp;#39;t jump on her. &lt;strong&gt;Furthermore,&lt;/strong&gt; he was still on a &lt;strong&gt;leash&lt;/strong&gt;, we had just came into the house and he was still wearing his harness and still on a leash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDITED 2 TO ADD&lt;/strong&gt;  - when we go to my in-laws for a shorter period of time (lunch, dinner), my dog stays at home. This time we want for the entire day (all of Thanksgiving day), so I wasn&amp;#39;t able to leave him at home alone for that long, that&amp;#39;s why we brought him with us.&lt;/p&gt;

"Tried posting somewhere else and I was told to try posting it here. I feel really selfish for how I'm feeling about this whole situation, and I would really love some opinions from unbiased people. I will be trying to keep it as vague as possible, because the last thing I want is for either of them to find this post. (all names in this story are fake names)

My best friend, ""Hannah"", and I met in our schools theatre department, and it was her who introduced me to ""Sam"" at the beginning of 2023. From the day that I met him, I could tell that he liked her, he even told me so. But in the summer, him and I hung out, and he mentioned to another person in the group that he didn't really like her anymore, and I thought nothing of it.

Around October, Sam texted me on snapchat and confessed that he liked me ""for a while now"" and asked me to our schools home coming, to which I told him to let me think about it. I had heard a rumor around this time that Hannah liked him, so I wanted to talk to her first. In person, I told her I had heard she liked him and asked her if she would be hurt if I went out with him, to which she said she never didn't like him and would be more than happy if I said yes. It was here that I found out that she helped him ask me out.

A week after home coming, Sam texted me on snap saying he didn't want to date until he graduated, and although I was hurt, I told him that I completely understood, and we remained friends. Upon hearing this, Hannah asked to see what he said and ""compare it with what happened between her and Sam"". When I asked what she meant by this, she told me that  he apparently was trying to push her into a relationship.

Now, two days ago, Sam texted me on snap again. He said he's heard from people that I like him, and he wanted to let me know that him and Hannah have been dating for a couple weeks now. I responded as if I wasn't really bothered, but to be honest I'm extremely angry. Although I am happy for them, I feel as if they've both disrespected me. I have to see both of them tomorrow, and I'm not looking forward to it. 

I feel so selfish for being angry but I also feel like I deserve time be angry. So please tell me, AITBF?


Update : 
I posted this about a week ago, and I figured I would give an update. (once again, it will be vague for privacy)

The entire week at school, I kind of ignored Sam as much as I could. He would text me and I would leave him on delivered. He didn't make much effort to talk to mein person, and the little he did was ignored. 

However, Hannah noticed something was up on day 1. She immediately got worried, and I told her that I was upset at another friend because I wasn't ready to talk to her. I knew I was going to eventually.

I went to my therapist on Tuesday and told her the whole situation because I wanted her advice. She told me that Sam didn't seem like someone I should be around, but she suggested that I talk to Hannah asap.

By the time Friday came around, a lot of my other close friends had realized what happened. One of them being ""Daisy"". Daisy felt really bad for me, and she desperately wanted to help, so she offered to text Hannah on my behalf and explain the situation to her, to which I agreed. 

Hannah texted me roughly an hour later and profusely apologized. She asked me to explain further as to how I felt so she had the entire story, and I did. She was very understanding, knowing her I should've known she would be, and was extremely apologetic and supportive of my feelings. We talked it out, and me and her are all good again. She said that Sam never meant to hurt me, I'm not sure how I'll handle things with him just yet. Thank you for all your comments, I appreciate all of you.

Update 2 :
They found the post. 

Sam texted me on Snap today, and he sent me this reddit post. He asked if it was me, to which I said yes. According to his message, he thought it was hilarious that I went to reddit, but he said he wouldn't be reading the comments because he already knew he was an asshole to me. (lol)

He asked if I would be mad if he sent it to Hannah, so I said he could. She also thought it was funny, but also felt bad that I went to reddit instead of my irl friends. She is also not reading the comments. 

Me and Hannah are all good, and we're actually better now since we've had a couple conversations. I'm not entirely sure how me and Sam will be, but I'm happy for my friend and that's all that matters. Of course, I'm still kind of upset, and they know that I am, but everything is being talked about and we are treating each other with respect now. (instead of going to reddit lmfao)

This will be my final update unless anything else crazy happens. Thank you all for your help again.

I [20NB] have a friend [19NB], and our relationship had kinda always pushed the boundaries between a platonic friendship and something more. We'd always flirt with each other, would often fall asleep while cuddling/spooning and were clearly both attracted to each other, however neither of us really made a serious move for a long time 

One night, after we'd both had way too many drinks and smoked some weed, they got on top of me and started kissing me, and we ended up having sex. The next morning was extremely awkward, and we didn't have a serious conversation about what happened apart from a few jokes about it

Due to a variety of reasons that I can't be bothered going into, life got in the way and we weren't able to see each other for a few months. During this time, I started to realize that I did have feelings for them, and decided that I would ask them out next time I saw them 

However, the next time we hung out, I found out that they were now dating someone [19F]. During that night, they would alternate between gushing about their new girlfriend and then flirting really intensely with me. They were getting very handsy with me; Pushing me down on the bed and getting on top of me, backing me against a wall and leaning in really close, even dry humping me at one point 

Obviously my head was spinning and I didn't know how to react. At one point I started leaning in for a kiss, but stopped myself. I also let slip that I had feelings for them not too long after

I don't remember this part as I was very drunk by this point, but apparently I asked them out later on in the night. I only found out a few days later when we were talking on the phone 

On this phone call, they got mad at me for asking them out and we got into a fight. They said that I shouldn't have admitted to having feelings for someone whose in a relationship. I responded by pointing out that they were the one that spent the whole night feeling me up at every opportunity. They then tried to claim that they only dry humped me ""platonically"", which imo is clearly bs

We haven't spoken in a couple weeks after the fight, and I'm wondering whether I'm the asshole in this situation

He was furious and started saying I deserved better and that he never expected him to cheat on me . I was flattered and I started  subtlely flirting with him and one thing lead to another and we started having sex in the upstairs bathroom.

A couple hours pass before I see the door open but it was not my husband opening the door it was a woman covering her chest with a towel and messy hair. I wanted to confront him but I had to stay calm and keep my composure. I drove to my aunties house where my family was at for thanksgiving. I was originally planning on going with Riley but after seeing that, I don’t want anything to do with that man. I ended up having a couple drinks and his uncle Fred 67(m) was on the couch with me and my auntie and he began asking why my husband was not coming and I explained that he is having a affair with another woman. He was furious and started saying I deserved better and that he never expected him to cheat on me . I was flattered and I started  subtlely flirting with him and one thing lead to another and we started having sex in the upstairs bathroom. And I think I forgot to lock the door because word got out that I started fucking Fred in the bathroom and this got out to my husband Riley who at the time didn’t know that I knew about the affair so his side of the family is mad at me and my family doesn’t know how to feel so am I the but face?&lt;/p&gt;

"Throw away account. I (25M) and my friend (26M) Matt have been best friends for 7 years now.

Recently at this past thanksgiving Matt invited me to spend Thanksgiving with him and his family. I of course said yes, I loved Matt's family and enjoyed being with them. I also had a huge crush on Matt's dad, (49M) James. This man was so fine, he looked like a sexier version of Brad Pitt and was the nicest person I have ever met. Context: Matt lost his mother when he was 19 and his dad has been single since. My crush on James was just a thing I had and I thought would never come true ever. But at this year's Thanksgiving Matt was treating me very differently. He sat and stood very close to me when he could and mostly talked to me the whole time. At first, I just thought he was being friendly but at dinner, I sat next to James and his hand made its way to my thigh. After dinner, neither of us said a thing.

Later after Matt's aunts/uncles and cousins left, Matt and his siblings wanted to go see a movie. James stayed back because he wanted to watch football and I lied saying I felt tired. After they left me and James started talking, and then talking turned into us going into James's room and proceeding to get it on.

When me and James were completely finished after many rounds we sat in James's bed and talked. He told me he was interested in me when we first met, which was 3 years ago at a dinner Matt took me too. By the time we were done talking Matt and his siblings came home. We freaked out and quickly got dressed before coming out. But it was too late, Matt's sister had seen us leave James' bedroom and told Matt. Matt flipped out at me, called me a slut and a fake friend, saying that I had ruined our friendship. I left Matt's home crying and drove back home.

"My mom, sister + niece were on a family trip and on thanksgiving day there was a lot of back and forth about where to go for dinner because my mom and I wanted a restaurant experience that had a show and my niece wanted Italian. 

My mom kept turning down my niece’s choice and I kept asking her to give more options but she was stubborn. My sister said “let’s just go where mom wants to go so can stop having her temper tantrums”. I went to my mom and said “mom let’s just go to where my niece wants to go so we don’t have any issues with my sister because she just made that comment.” I had the best intentions when I said that because my sister is very sensible (edit: sensitive) and gets mad over everything.

When I order the Uber, I order it to where my niece wanted to eat. I mention to my mom that we should split the night between the two places and her and I can have a drink here and that way we’re all happy with what we eat! When we get to the table my mom mentions the suggestion to my sister and once again, she makes a face and said “ok. I’m going to eat here with my daughter.” Turns to my niece and says “I’m so sorry about this.” And I go “wait. What? What’s wrong?” And she goes “nothing.” And I’m like why are you apologizing? And she goes “respect that i don’t want to talk to you” and sitting there so confused snd i go why not? I need to be able to have a convo with you and she yells at me that she doesn’t want to. 

I go to the bathroom for about 15 minutes to sob because I’m so worn out by this type of treatment from her when i had the best intentions to make sure everyone was happy. I can hear her and my mom fighting at the table. I go back to the table with my headphones. I tell her all i wanted was to be able to talk. She begins to call me two face &amp; fake. That i want to act like a saint but I’m not, she doesn’t like or fuck with people like me and that I act so exclusive and special.

I pay, leave and wait for the Uber outside and I begin to talk to her. She says “go ahead, vent, go ahead and say what you wanna say to this fucking bitch” (referring to herself) she’s yelling at and while I’m sitting down on a curb i look at her and say to her “look at yourself, are you happy? You’ve treated me like shit for no reason.” And she begins to get in my face and say “you provoked me and you got me. You wanted me, well you fucking found me” and at this point i get up in her face back and tell her to calm the fuck down. I tell her she is delusional. 

She says she doesn’t like how I’m a victim, that my tears don’t matter to her, that i always cry. I respond by saying “me a victim? Your entire life is summarized by you being victim” And she says “you don’t know what I’ve been through or my childhood traumas” and I’m like oh here we go again. Boohoo. It keeps escalating and I said “you’re such a phony bitch”. In response to something she said to me. That statement hurt her and she began to cry and the argument ended.

"I (22M) met my GF (22F) 8 months ago at the start of our last semester of college. It's each of ours' first relationship. About half of our relationship has been in person, and half via long distance (we have each visited once since). She's the only person I can truly relax around, is my best friend (and currently only friend, a separate problem), and, barring this post's circumstances, our relationship is very strong / I didn't have doubts about our mutual love. We video call nearly every day and message randomly throughout.

I was initially exposed to weed 2.5 years ago which became an on/off thing but escalated into mostly daily usage my senior year. She never asked if I use weed, or even mentioned it (despite it being pervasive locally) except to point out Snoop had quit on the day that news broke, and I haven't said a word. I had incidentally stopped due to both a lack of access and no clear cravings following graduation (now in graduate school), but caved during a bout of loneliness \~2 months ago. This snowballed into my most unhinged use, i.e. multiple bong rips every day. I have never said anything about my usage because I (initially) thought she wouldn't like me or (later) leave me because of it, but, I know that lying by omission about my usage is horrific behavior, and I have felt guilty about it throughout our relationship. Moreover, I don't think she has any suspicion about my usage. A few days ago, I came to terms that this was having a significant detrimental impact on my life because of built up guilt from not telling my gf, poor academic performance, struggle to clean apartment/do dishes, depressed, etc. and am attempting to quit cold turkey (currently 3 days).

Notably, I did not experience any issues with effectively going cold turkey/stopping usage in the past, but due to my increased usage I have dealt with brutal withdrawal symptoms: insomnia (complete inability to sleep in this case), unable to eat, extremely irritable, mood changes (I've cried more in the past 3 days than the past 12 years). I'm powering through it because I love her and want to change but in my sleep-deprived ruminating I realized something else: quitting won't alleviate my feelings of guilt, but adds nuance.

Clearly, irrespective of whether I quit, I will experience significant guilt about not having told my gf, and so I can't imagine that I won't end up telling her. However, I am obviously still very scared to tell her as, even if I remain sober, there was a clear breach of trust in not having told her up until then, and I am not sure how emotionally capable I would be of having overcome this addiction and told her only to lose her (obviously, if I don't tell her and she finds out I had smoked, she could leave too). Essentially, my question is, separately from my personal guilt to tell her, if I can successfully remain sober, do I have a moral responsibility to inform her that I quit? I am open to any and all advice in this situation.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-26T04:00:06.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (22M) met my GF (22F) 8 months ago at the start of our last semester of college.

"Right so. For the most part when leadership were there I was fine. Didn’t say or do anything stupid. 

towards the middle of the evening I went for a cigarette and the door knocked me a bit and one guy went “ooo steady on” but it was just that the door knocked me. And yes I was tipsy but not totally messed up.

later in the night I think I walked over and said that was rude making out like I’m some p*sshead. I also touched his arm for no reason while I said this. I then had no recollection of the rest of the conversation at all because he brought me a shot.

But by the end. My close colleague and I had a couple more and by the end it was both of us and a few others. As my close colleague and I were heading home I fell over and then because of the motion in the taxi I took home with her I had to step out and throw up.

"I(19F) am a student doing BTech, im an introvert who has a handful of friends. i have anxiety and trouble making new friends so i keep my interaction very limited with people unless its necessary. I think i have proper social skills, i just try to do my work and stay home or with my friends.

Me and my friend, lets call her Leah(19f) were friends for an year and she was one of the sweetest and nicest friends i had. We were classmates in our college for 3 months after which she changed her college but we stayed in touch and got closer, we hung out very often and did sleepover a few times. She had been always very conscious about how she made others feel by the way she talked and I am pretty outspoken. We were pretty different personality-wise but we enjoyed. My boyfriend would also hangout with us sometimes. I was her unspoken therapist and she was mine. Recently, she had started to get a bit distant and very possessive of me (she asked if i was making new friends and got offended that i had friends other than her, told me she gets jealous etc) and i brushed it off. She rainchecked on our plans 2-3 times, after which i confronted her so she got offended and started bad-mouthing about me to my boyfriend. I texted her with the screenshots of what he sent me, and she told me i have an attitude issue and im an attention seeker for being so offended about it all and it is my fault all my friends keep on leaving me. I told her it was low of her to throw my insecurities on my face to win an argument so she told me she has had enough of me and doesnt want to be my friend anymore. She blamed me for not paying attention to her whenever she talked to me or always having some drama in my life and for having high standards and expecting people to treat me nice.

On this I told her she was a people-pleasing, self centered, insecure girl who was jealous of me since she couldnt be like me. I told her she was a try-hard for trying to get people to like her.

We have completely ghosted each other because of this and broken our friendship but i noticed she was still using my netflix. I asked her to stop using it.

"This happen two years ago, but it came to my mind recently and I brought it up to someone who I know and didn’t get the respond that I expected. Which is why I’m here.

Sometime after I turned 18, a man who I didn’t recognized added me and my father on facebook. Instead of writing directly to me, he wrote to my father and asked him to give me his number. Obviously, my father being confused about it, asked me who it was. When I didn’t recognize the man, I decided to write to him on facebook and question him.

Me: Who are you?
Man: I think we spoke some years ago.
Me: No we didn’t.
Him: Yes. At [where I live]
Me: How old are you? Where did we speak?
Him: I’m 25. I think we spoke at [where I live]. In the park.

At this point I felt pretty freaked out. Because a man much older than me, who I don’t recognize, knows where I lived. The park he mentioned was right outside my apartment. I asked him who he knew there, and he let me know that he were friends with the fathers of some children I used to play with when I was younger.
I asked how long ago it was that we met, and he told me it was around 3-4 years ago. Which would have made me 14-15 years old. Though I think it was probably even as far as 5 years ago since I stopped hanging out in that park and that people when I was around 13.
He said that when he met me back then, I seemed cool. That I liked video games, or maybe pokemon.

I told him that I was uncomfortable by the fact that he was writing to me now and asking for my father to hand me his number.
He asked for forgiveness and said he wouldn’t bother me again.
Then a some weeks after he wrote again, wishing me a good weekend. That was when I blocked him.

For some reason, this situation came back to mind recently and I told an acquaintance about it. I said how it had made me uncomfortable that an adult man had apparently found 13 year old me ”cool” and decided to hit me up once I was legally an adult. I expected my friend to agree, but she didn’t. Instead, she said it was romantic that a man had ”waited” for me. She made me feel like I was overreacting with how I went about it and such. And now I’m wondering if that is the case. I’m 20 now and when I see 13 year olds, I view them as children. When I turn 25, I cannot see myself ever contacting someone who I met once when they were a child, when they turn into an adult. I guess its one thing to maybe bump into them again years later and finding a connection. But personally I don’t even think I’d date a 18 year old when I’m 25. It feels like those years are such a big difference at this point of life. Maturity wise and such. Despite wanting to appear mature at 18, I knew even back then that I wasn’t an ”adult” in the way someone in their mid to late twenties are.

I’ll stop the rant now, but basically I’m wondering if I’m a buttface for being hostile and then blocking that man over this.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-24T13:13:20.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happen two years ago, but it came to my mind recently and I brought it up to someone who I know and didn’t get the respond that I expected. Which is why I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime after I turned 18, a man who I didn’t recognized added me and my father on facebook. Instead of writing directly to me, he wrote to my father and asked him to give me his number. Obviously, my father being confused about it, asked me who it was. When I didn’t recognize the man, I decided to write to him on facebook and question him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: Who are you?
Man: I think we spoke some years ago.
Me: No we didn’t.
Him: Yes. At [where I live]
Me: How old are you? Where did we speak?
Him: I’m 25. I think we spoke at [where I live]. In the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I felt pretty freaked out. Because a man much older than me, who I don’t recognize, knows where I lived. The park he mentioned was right outside my apartment. I asked him who he knew there, and he let me know that he were friends with the fathers of some children I used to play with when I was younger.
I asked how long ago it was that we met, and he told me it was around 3-4 years ago. Which would have made me 14-15 years old. Though I think it was probably even as far as 5 years ago since I stopped hanging out in that park and that people when I was around 13.
He said that when he met me back then, I seemed cool. That I liked video games, or maybe pokemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him that I was uncomfortable by the fact that he was writing to me now and asking for my father to hand me his number.
He asked for forgiveness and said he wouldn’t bother me again.
Then a some weeks after he wrote again, wishing me a good weekend. That was when I blocked him.&lt;/p&gt;

Okay everyone it's finally time I figure this out! My fiance and I (we'll call her Corgi) have been together since 2021. Since we've been together her family (specifically her mother) has been vocal about not liking me and even saying I'm a liar and a bad parent to our children. In 2022 she told my fiance that I lied about being in the military and that I deserved to be shot by her husband for being a liar. When I showed proof of my enlistment and discharge, I was told that there was no changing her mind.

Now to recent events, we had been living in a house her grandparents own. Her uncle had bought a house the previous year but always stated he wanted the house we lived in. We mentioned trading homes and taking over his lease, but that offer was rejected as he'd want his money from selling the property as he's done remodeling (just to the drive way). While we were in the hospital with our newborn daughter her mom messaged her and told us we needed to find somewhere else to stay, which we didn't mind but needed time to look and felt it was inappropriate to message us this when we were in the hospital with our newborn daughter.

Well, two months of her grandpaarents and uncle harassing us, I finally told them how my fiance felt (she had been telling me she felt like an outsider to her family). Her mom messaged her and said they all have done so much for us, and that I'm out of my mind and should be grateful. Her mom doesn't help watch kids, pay for any of our stuff, and has only seen her grandkids in passing since they were born (my Fiance's oldest daughter is 4 from before our relationship). Well that sparked a whole argument which led to her grandparents filing a small claims suit with the court and LYING saying they sent a sheriff to our house to deliver an eviction.

When we finally moved they dropped the lawsuit and threw away most of our belongings after the first day of our new lease when we were still moving things out. So am I the asshole for not wanting to communicate with her family now because of this?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-24T03:19:17.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay everyone it&amp;#39;s finally time I figure this out!

"Many years ago, I bought into Disney Vacation Club. It’s their version of timesharing, and I got in just under the wire when the getting was really good. Over the years, I’ve bought extra points, and now I have the luxury of staying at their five star resorts, as well as traveling around the world.

My first piece I purchased in 2007, and added two more pieces as time went on so I do have a quite a lot of points. And considering I’m a single person at this point I’ve been able to gift vacations and a honeymoon to people.

Easily 10 years ago I paid off the cost of the timeshares, so I only have annual dues. They’re not cheap by any means, but any one vacation I would take in any year or gift to somebody is worth well beyond what the cost of my dues are. All of the people that I’ve taken, family and friends, I have been really impressed with the way I organize our trips to make it look as if we’re being spontaneous, but everything is planned practically to the minute.

So anyway, here’s my hypothetical situation. Buying these timeshares are for 40 to 50 years of ownership. My long-term goal was to be able to take a huge chunk of family and have one of those big chaotic, happy vacations that I’ve always seen other people do.

Due to reasons, one of my nephews, along with his wife, and therefore, children cannot be welcome on this trip. Also, my stepfather who was recently widoed from my mother’s Passing last year, is extremely LC with me. 

Everybody lives on the other side of the country, so they are all a lot closer to each other than they are to me, and I do not want to stir the pot anymore than it has been recently due to these two family members showing some true colors that I didn’t even know existed. 

WIBTAH if I selectively invited family members? Should I just scrap the idea due to the change in circumstances? 

While I do have quite a lot of points, I would still have to bring my family members in multiple batches over a year or two-ish. My concern is for when the time comes that I’ve finished bringing the people that I want to and the ones that have been excluded wonder when their invitation is coming, if they would even care in the first place. I don’t know because I’ve gone and seen the family without specifically visiting them, and nothing was mentioned (which doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t care,) and knowing the heinous things that they’ve posted on various social media platforms that define who they are, I and the rest of my family are quite repulsed.

"So my (24F) brother (33M) and I were having a conversation on our way to our grandmother's house. I told him about a house I was looking at in that area which I decided I didn't want to buy. He said I could get a place in a town where my job is and I told him I want to get a house in that town, but knowing that area, housing would be expensive. It would be nice though.

Then my brother mentioned how if I got a house in the town near my job, then he can crash there when he gets drunk at a bar in that same town. He always goes out on the weekends to drink or do something with his friends. I immediately told him that wasn't happening and he says that it *will* happen. I once again told him that wasn't happening. He then said ""you wouldn't let me drive home while drunk, would you?"" and I told him that I can drive him to his house but he isn't coming to my place. 

He then started saying how it has to be *his* truck that has to go for him but again I refused. He then said it was decided that I will let him stay at my place when he goes to bars and get drunk. I once again told him that wasn't happening. He then said he was going to tell our mom about my refusal and I asked what the heck would that accomplish. He said she would take his side and be disappointed in me for not helping him.

Extra side note; my brother and I don't see eye to eye at all. He's homophobic, transphobic, racist, and sometimes sexist. He always made me feel bad and I'm always the one who gets told off for not ignoring the things my brother says to me.

"I feel very uncomfortable around them and would rather not see them in holiday

im usually shy though unless I warm up to ppl

but like my parents kept hinting that if I was fired from my job , than I could get money from the government. Which probs isn’t true. But I had told them I put my two weeks in and so I was confused when they said that. Bc I quit so why would they assume I was fired when I have never been fired from a job or had any conduct issues. They say I have oppositional defiance disorder when I have never had trouble with teachers, jobs, friends. I’ve never been a bully or a mean girl. When I pulled up texts to prove to them I quit they were like staring at me phone.. like tf? Why am I proving this to you

they also say that my roommate and I bullied our college suitmate which made her move out. This is not true, the girl moved to the different form bc she switched majors. But what a bold assumption to make abt me since I have legit never bullied anyone. and yes my roommate and I described the other girl as kinda strange bc she was. i was always nice and inclusive w her. But some people are kinda rude or have something strange abt them and you don’t have to be mean to them to be aware of it.

even In elementary school I was a serious runner and my friend joined the team just for fun. I was around 12-13 years old. When my shoe fell off I asked my friend who was on the team for fun to wait for me. She said no and kept running, sure it might be kinda selfish of me to ask her to wait for me but she wasn’t a serious runner and it wouldn’t have made sense for me to go from being a 6 minute mike runner to a 12 minute mike to run by this friend daily.

"My wife(43F) and I(45M) have son who is just turning 16, our son is on the spectrum and ever since knowing this I have tried my best to raise him by reading all I could and being informed on the subject, while my wife wants to raise him the same way any other kid in our country is raised.

Ironically In recent matters a few months ago our son got into a fight with his uncle(36M), I know his uncle can be a bit of an asshole sometimes and my son has trouble controlling his anger when pushed beyond his limits, ever since that incident my wife and her side of the family began treating our son like he is a monster, they refuse to talk to him or they keep making threats to send him away even though I have asked for them to stop before things get worse. my wife would keep lecturing our son that he needs to change forgetting that he has autism and every time our son tries to explain himself she ignores him and goes on saying the same thing over and over constantly reminding my son he is the problem and not her toxic family(imo). 

few months later our son got suspended for fighting with his entire class (I couldn't believe it either) turns out his class has been bullying him because they didn't know he was on the spectrum so his child-like/strange behavior was always a huge issue to them so they kept doing him things he did not like until he snapped. my wife on the other hand was quick to explain to our son that those people were in the wrong and he did nothing wrong, this confused both me and my son who hates it when you try to use his autism as an excuse for anything

while talking with my wife on the situation I brought up how she was quick to use our son's autism as an excuse when dealing with strangers but when it comes to her toxic family she blames our son. she insisted that since her family provides for him also, they are not in the wrong, I got annoyed and told decided to tell her to let me handle our son from now on, I don't want her family or anyone else laying a finger on him because clearly she is not fit to raise our son if she is going to treat him like a monster when her family is being abusive but treat him like a baby when other people cause him to have meltdowns, she got upset and told me I am being stupid.

&lt;p&gt;while talking with my wife on the situation I brought up how she was quick to use our son&amp;#39;s autism as an excuse when dealing with strangers but when it comes to her toxic family she blames our son. she insisted that since her family provides for him also, they are not in the wrong, I got annoyed and told decided to tell her to let me handle our son from now on, I don&amp;#39;t want her family or anyone else laying a finger on him because clearly she is not fit to raise our son if she is going to treat him like a monster when her family is being abusive but treat him like a baby when other people cause him to have meltdowns, she got upset and told me I am being stupid. &lt;/p&gt;

"I (20M) am friends with a girl (20F) in my college and we’ve been friends for about 7-8 months now. We’ve spent a lot of time together, studied together, and spent hours on phone calls. For the record, I don’t like her, we’re just good friends. However, it was always me who initiated conversations, and planned activities we could do together. She never took the initiative to do anything and even wouldn't reply to my texts for days and the only excuse she would come up with was that her phone was with her parents, but at the same time, I could see her like my other friends’ posts on Instagram in the time period when her phone was “supposedly” with her parents. The only thing I’m sure of is that she’s comfortable talking to me on a personal level. Although she has never straight up denied doing any activity that I’ve proposed to her, she does come up with random excuses multiple times that just postpone our plans which makes me contemplate her willingness to do things with me. The confusing part is that she has said multiple times that she likes spending time with me, talking to me on call, studying with me, and doing things in general with me. This makes me feel like I’m just overthinking and there’s nothing more to it. This just talks about her behavior in general.

  
Lately, there have been several incidents that have made me question our friendship. She has almost stopped texting me and replies to my texts after days. She would promise to watch a TV show with me, and then when I called her to watch the show with me (on Discord call), she’d just not pick up her phone and would come up with some excuse. Many instances have occurred when in a group configuration, she would completely ignore what I was saying, not to mention that she would even cut me off halfway through what I was saying. She has even lied to me about going to parties so that she won’t have to invite me (although idc about these parties). It’s not just the parties, but all the group activities which my friends do together without me and I suspect that she’s the one who’s asked everyone to not invite me. For the record, I don't have any beefs with anyone. 

  
In my opinion, she just doesn’t respect me and the efforts I’m putting in for our friendship to last. So now, I have decided that I will just completely cut off with her. I don’t want to maintain any relationship with her. I’m not denying the fact that I’ve had fun talking to her, spending time with her, and studying with her. But, I’m just completely drained out and don’t have the energy left inside me to initiate conversations and activities just for her to back out at the last minute. She is a very nice person and has even helped me multiple times, but I feel that her niceness doesn’t justify the cold treatment she’s giving me. I have already stopped replying to her texts.  
I just wanna know what I should be doing. Is it right on my part to stop talking to her?

"This is a situation that happened over a year ago but it’s still bothering me.

So for context, I have a habit of playing with individual strands of my hair. It’s kinda a texture thing- I just like the way that the courser strands feeling so I kinda pick at them while I’m doing work or just watching tv. I’ve done this since I was in high school and I would equate it to a nail biting habit.

Around the time that my bf and I started dating he noted that he doesn’t like when I play with my hair like that in public because he thinks that it looks like I’m stroking a cock. I thought this was insane at first but then I realized that maybe by putting my hands in the 👌🏻 position while picking out/stroking an individual strand of hair could look sorta sexual. 

I told him that I kinda thought it was uncalled for to tell me to stop doing this habit I’d had for almost 10 years but that since I could kinda see his point- I’d try not to do it in public.

Anytime I’d forget and start playing with my hair in public he would give me a dirty look and I’d stop. However he started getting upset when I would do this privately at home too because he thought I was just doing it to make him mad.

One day we just got into a long argument but once it was over we got in the car and drove to go out. I was feeling still upset after our argument and I unknowing started playing with my hair- not just one strand but more just twirling sections of hair while it sat in my lap (I have very long hair). I didn’t even realize I was doing this but he noticed and made some snide comments like “Having fun there?” and “Is that what you were doing all day at work?” suggesting that I purposely do this in public for attention.

I kinda lost my shit at this point tbh. I was just really fed up and I snapped at him and told him he was being a “little bitch” about this hair thing.

I instantly felt bad for saying this and profusely apologized. I still feel bad though as I know that’s a horrible thing to call a man.

"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/181eo7w/find_out_her_intentions_before_meeting_up_with_my/) the other day about getting back in touch with my ex. The post goes into more detail but we ended on decent terms, she initiated the breakup but I was also feeling like I wanted to see other people. We only dated for about 6 months but I know she was really falling for me and was scared of that/had commitment issues.

It's been about 2 years since then and I just saw her on a dating app and I know she swiped right on me. I've been thinking about matching and starting a conversation and I'd be open to maybe giving things a shot again.

I've been seeing someone for a bit over 3 months now, we wanted to take things slow. She told me she was on the dating apps (where we met) to ""take things slow and meet people along the way"". We haven't talked much about where we see the relationship going, just that we were both open to short term and are still kinda figuring things out. Since that conversation though I feel like she has been really into me and interested in maybe something more serious (just can tell by the way she acts, I know we need to talk about it). 

I have no idea if my ex would be serious about getting back together, hence why I would potentially want to wait to tell the girl I'm seeing. If she did want to get back together then I'd basically be forced to end things with the girl I've been seeing, which would be difficult but at least I'd have a strong reason to.

I know either way that I need make sure this girl I'm currently seeing is on the same page as me regarding the seriousness of our relationship. If my ex turns me down and the girl I'm seeing now was open to continuing something on a casual basis that could still be good. If I end things with her and then my ex turns me down I'd have lost both connections.

"ADVICE WELCOME - Emma &amp; I used to be very close - college friend group now scattered around the country. She, Sophia &amp; Lily hosted my baby shower for my first child 10+ years ago. A lot has changed since.

Several years ago, Emma got rear-ended at a stpolight&amp; was injured. She was understandably shaken up &amp; posted about it on FB… I didn’t see the post because a few hours before her accident, I was seriously “life changing injuries” hurt in one of those “holy shit did you see what happened on the Turnpike” accidents.So I was peeing glass shards &amp; trying to remember my name for the paramedics when people were expecting me to rush to fellate Emma. We’d recently moved to a new town for my husband’s job &amp; I knew nobody.

Long story short, the at-fault driver &amp; even some family mmebers - were spreading damaging and false stories about my accident - to try to intimidate me out of medical care and legal action. Emma was an early adopter/spreader of the harmful stories. She went on a really vile rant on FB about how I was ""selfish"" to focus on getting the medical care I needed to stay alive &amp; not think of others' wants/needs (I wish to G\*D this were fiction!)

In response to the created moral panic, many people in this town made some extremely poor decisions. Certain folks are facing professional &amp; criminal consequences.

Last year I took a group video chat from a hospital bed - in a massive spinal brace, IV, etc. People were visibly surprised &amp; I quickly changed the subject.Emma later texted supposedly to apologize but quickly devolved into personal insults about how I didn’t deserve medical care or compensation for my injuries. I blocked her.

Sophia texted later that Emma felt harmed by my medical care. (Sophia and I also were very close once - Emma’s histrionics and Sophia’s concerning behavior surrounding them have severely damaged that relationship).

The at-fault driver’s camp had been crowing about how they were going to put me into prison and/or a mental asylum… Their stories against me at deposition  were HORRIFIC… but fortunately so outlandish and poorly-constructed they imploded quickly. Case settled, records sealed, I'm not locked up.

People are starting to put 2 + 2 together and it's been... interesting.

I just got an invitation to Emma’s baby shower a couple weeks out, hosted by Sophia, Lily &amp; Jasmine.

I'd like to RSVP no. Instead, I scheduled an accident-related surgical procedure for the day before.

"i have 3 siblings (2 older sisters, one younger brother) and both my parents are involved. my older sisters and i are all 25+, bother is still a minor. 

so, tomorrows thanksgiving and i’m really sick. not covid, just flu/head cold like symptoms. sore throat, congestion, headache, weakness, disoriented - all that fun stuff, and so is my bf. my oldest sister (29) is hosting thanksgiving for the first time, and i was genuinely excited for it. so i was bummed being so sick bc i didn’t think i should go. (my dad has a lot of medical conditions and he doesn’t need getting sick on top of it)

i told my second oldest sister (27) about this, telling her how sick i felt and how i didn’t know if i was gonna go. i’m closer to this sister, my oldest one scares me i’m not gonna lie. she replied saying it’s okay and she just hopes i feels better

she then texts me that she told oldest sisters about me most likely not going, and she’s extremely sad. that she’s apparently been prepping for a week, wants to take a picture with the family, and start a ‘tradition’. she was asking me if there was any way for me to compromise in going, like wearing a mask and getting picked up by my (extremely unreliable) mother so i didn’t have to risk driving feeling disoriented. 

this just sounds like hell for me. my mom is the worst with rides, and if i’m really sick, i would want to leave when i can leave. that’s why i mentioned my bf being sick as well, he shouldn’t be driving around and going out either, so i don’t feel comfortable asking him to go as well or pick me up/drop me off. and then wearing a mask for hours on end, while already being congested and coughing like crazy. 

i just don’t know what to do. i already felt bad for not wanting to go and prioritizing rest, but now i feel like they’re trying to make me feel even worse for not going. 

i said i’d be happy to have another thanksgiving dinner with everyone on an upcoming weekend, all food paid for by me, to make up for it. but it doesn’t seem like that will make anyone else happy. 

would i be a buttface if i don’t go..? i’m so conflicted.

edit: so i got significantly worse throughout the day, and now my voice is gone and i feel like death. my sister (27) left me on read regarding the matter earlier. so i texted her again saying i’m officially not going about 5 hours ago and still have not got a reply. they obviously only care about me going and not about me getting better. so i appreciate everyone’s feedback and the people giving advice on how i can still be ‘present’, but at this point i do not want to.

&lt;p&gt;i said i’d be happy to have another thanksgiving dinner with everyone on an upcoming weekend, all food paid for by me, to make up for it. but it doesn’t seem like that will make anyone else happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would i be a buttface if i don’t go..? i’m so conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: so i got significantly worse throughout the day, and now my voice is gone and i feel like death. my sister (27) left me on read regarding the matter earlier. so i texted her again saying i’m officially not going about 5 hours ago and still have not got a reply. they obviously only care about me going and not about me getting better. so i appreciate everyone’s feedback and the people giving advice on how i can still be ‘present’, but at this point i do not want to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you for all of your replies. i truly appreciate everyone’s feedback &lt;/p&gt;

"I (22f) have twins (7,M/F) with my middle school ex-boyfriend (23). We've dealt with a lot of ups and downs, but since the kids were about 4 years old we had a great, healthy co-parenting relationship. He would occasionally annoy me, and I did have to set boundaries now and then, but we were going to parent meetings together, being good with sharing, he was being on time, basically a completely present dad. Prior to being 4, the kids hardly were around their dad because he was in a lot of heavy drug usage and generally had no interest, unless it was to flirt to see if I'd mess around with him. After I wouldn't off that ten-minute visit with the kids, he would go ghost for months.

I tried to set all of this aside once the kids turned 4 because at that point we were 18 and he'd gotten clean and seemed more dedicated to his work and family. However, an important thing to note is that I had a best friend since before I met this guy, we'll call him Arlo. Arlo and I began dating when the kids were 3 months old. He went to visit me in the hospital during the labor, and was always there for the kids without me asking ever. I'm currently with Arlo to this day, and while he does not like my kids' dad, he will make his best efforts to be kind for the sake of the kids. BD (baby daddy) has yelled obscenities at him multiple times, which I ended up forgiving. He randomly blocked me everywhere after being consistent for three years and said he needed ""time to heal from our relationship""

WHAT RELATIONSHIP? WE HAD KIDS TOGETHER WHEN WE WERE KIDS. He randomly drunk-texted me at 2 A.M saying he did everything for nothing, that what was the point if I was going to stay with ""annoying weak Arlo"" instead of ""trying for our family."" He has not contacted our kids at all since, or made any effort to see them. He still has me on his Twitter where he tweets about how he began doing crack cocaine. I really have to deal with this man the rest of my life? No. I think he needs to step up and be a dad, because he was never a boyfriend--he cheated on me several times, pressured me to do things I did not want to do, and has gaslit me by faking doing horrible things. I'm just exhausted of him at this point. My kids cry to Arlo about him. It hurts to watch them be abandoned over and over.

"Hey Reddit, I could really use some advice or perspective on a situation that's been bothering me for a while.

About a year ago, I was facing my final exams for graduation when I received the heartbreaking news that my aunt, who was my life support, had cancer and was dying. Consequently, I was diagnosed with depression and stress.

As time passed, my aunt sadly passed away, and my family faced a difficult period. Struggling with my own mental health, I reached a low point and attempted unaliving myself (nothing to be proud of), leading to my admission to a mental health institution and extensive therapy. During this time, I made the decision not to burden my friend group, knowing we were all dealing with college stress, so I didn't share the details of the situation. Moreover, my doctor suggested that I avoid social media, so I froze all my accounts (fb, ig, sc, tt, wsp) and informed my friends that I'd be taking a break.

Months later, a mutual friend reached out to me and asked why I had a fight with my previous friend group. I was a little shocked by this since I didn't see it that way and asked them to tell me more about it. My friend said that she was confused given that my friends did know about my hospitalization, as one of my parents had reached out to them. Shockingly, I also learned they had been saying negative things about me, even expressing relief that I was no longer part of our friend circle among other mutual friends.

Feeling hurt, I reached out to them to apologize for my sudden disappearance but only one friend agreed to talk, while others demanded ""private apologies."" 
While I acknowledge that leaving may have caused confusion or could even have been hurtful, I did tell them I'd be back when I felt better; I just needed space to heal.
Learning about the negative comments is disheartening, especially since I've always supported them. I also found out that they upload TikTok videos saying how awful of a friend I was or Instagram posts where they write things such as ""hope X never comes back."" Now all of our mutual friends think I am the asshole but I don't know why?
I keep thinking that if we had any sort of problem during our friendship, why did they not talk to me to sort things out?

But, yet again, I don't want to see my situation only through my perspective because maybe I did something really bad and can't tell. I also don't know if I should go back to social media because I am scared that everyone will be an ass to me because of everything that has been said.

"My boyfriend and I got drunk together for the first time yesterday. We were at my apartment half watching TV and cuddling. He was pretty gone making childish jokes (e.g. What do you call a bear with no teeth? a gummy bear!) and then cackling. I’ve never seen him smile that big especially at such a close angle. His crooked teeth turned me off. I was repulsed, honestly. As if I just smelled burned hair. I grimaced. That view coupled with the annoying jokes made me blurt out,

“I don’t know what’s funnier, your jokes or your teeth. Please stop.”

He didn’t respond. He just did a half smile, kissed me on the cheek then got up to make us something to eat. Hot dogs and sweet beans. 

I don’t think he understood I insulted his teeth. They really bug me. And I don’t think I can tell him straight up that his teeth need correcting while I’m sober.

So…

 I’ve decided to only pick restaurants next door to Orthodontists offices for our weekly dinner dates hoping he subconsciously picks up the idea he would look better with straighter teeth. I also bought him mint flavored toothpicks for Christmas. 

AITB?

Would it be rude to tell him he should get braces? That I think he’d look more attractive? I know they’re expensive. Idk. Maybe I should just get used to his smile. It’s unique. His charm. Idk.

"My best friend and I have been  friends since we were 11 years old (we are now 35/F). We  always hung  out, talked nearly every day and were so close. But at the beginning of 2023, right before my birthday, my friend texted me saying she needed  to prioritize being in spaces where  she was free to express herself  without being judged and was taking ""a  step back"". Then she ghosted me,  removed me from social media and I have not heard from her since.

I  have been so confused and upset. I have no idea what I did wrong or why  she is doing this. She is not allowing a chance to talk it out with  her. I don't know if she is going through anything. She is still talking  to our mutual friend though who says she is fine, to give her time and  she will come around.

Well it has  been months and still no reply to my texts. Last week I decided to send  her a gift with a note saying I was thinking of her. Still no acknowledgement of that, either.

I am so sad and confused. I don't know what is going on. I wasted $50 as a last chance icebreaker to see if that will get her to come out of her shell and acknowledge me.

"We’re both 30, together for 3 months, exclusive and monogamous.

I would never cheat on her, but she believes in monogamy much more than I do, whereas I’ve been in open relationships and had a lot of sexual experiences, including orgies. She only had two boyfriends/sexual partners before me, but she is much kinkier in bed than me.

My best friend has a very sexually open new girlfriend and he wanted to try going to a sex positive party, but without her (she already attended many). He asked me if I could come to support him since he is super shy and tbh not the most attractive guy around and quite awkward. He isn’t really planning to do anything physical. I said I need to ask my gf.

My gf gave me an immediate no. I said I would never do anything, let alone cheat on her, I don’t even know what these parties are like, I’m just there to support my best friend. She said she knew from some ex-roommates what they are like in our city, people get STD tested, no one does anything without your consent, but people go there to fuck. She got very upset, started crying and cried even more as I was asking her extra questions.

She said she 100% trusts me but she would feel very uncomfortable and this is not how she imagines her monogamous partner to be, especially when, I quote “I do everything in bed for you, I look sexy [she used to be a fashion model] and dress in lingerie and send you videos and nudes and buy toys and you still want to spend your night between some people who wanna fuck and get validation out of it.”

" For some context: I (15F) have been doing online school since 6th grade. I have made only one friend (15F) in 6th grade and we still talk to this day, but I haven't seen her in 4 years. My parents don't know her, but they don't like her because they think she's the one convincing me to go in person school, even though I actually want to go in person.

I wanted to see my friend again so we both were thinking of going to the mall on my birthday. I asked my mom, but she said we still have 3 more months left so we'll see.

"I (16f) live with my dad, lets call him david and my technically step mom, Christina. From age 12 Christina has been my mother for all purposes except biology with me going low contact with my bio mom. Recently, Christina has been getting angrier and angrier with how we clean. My room is never spotless but i do my chores that arent my room pretty good, not perfect but good yet she always makes comments about how i am the messiest in the family and i cant clean anything right and that she has to do everything herself. Now i could see her side of the story with the house being a little messy at times until she adds on things like ""i have to work all day and come home and clean up after you guys and cook too"". Now i do not cook and she does make me feel bad about it but i dont mind that. I attend highschool until around 3, she doesnt give chores until 4-4:30 if that. Sometimes she doesnt give chores and i have to provide me and my siblings a list. I take AP classes during school with loads of work and a college class after school aswell with my parents demanding i get a B or above with a rare instance of them letting a C by. Yesterday (sunday), we were cleaning for when my siblings visit for thanksgiving and it was mainly me and my little brother doing all the work with my dad playing with the dogs then leaving to get my sister. She got angry and told us if we did our chores right we wouldnt have to do all this.

"Here some context: 3 weeks after being dumped I tried to reconnect with my ex and have a serious talk about our issues to get back together. She told me that my presence is making her uncomfortable and she is connecting to other guys now and had a date already lined up.

In response to that I told her that I'm not up for the competition and there is nothing I can do to stop what she has planned, so I left. Some hours later she reached out to me claiming I'm putting too much pressure on her showing up like that. I apologized for crossing her boundaries and a few days later I texted a long message basically saying that if there is no progress to be made I'm just letting go of this relationship and I fully respect her decision to break up. Her response was a mix of rage and ""things will never change"" and no interest in talking to me.

Now since I thought she would like to move on and since there were already new guys on her radar I just hooked up with a random girl at a party out of frustration while my ex was on a date with someone else. I felt horrible and what I did felt like cheating to me.

I didn't expect to hear from her but some days later she reached out again and we talked and I told her what happened. She immediately told me to f. off and blocked me everywhere. (She also claimed she didn't do anything sexual with the new guys)

"Hi everyone, I’m posting from a throwaway account for anonymity. This has been irritating me since last night, so I just want a second opinion I guess. (My original post was removed from r/AITA, so apologies if you’ve already seen it before.)

My (21F) friend (22NB) just had their birthday last night. It was super fun, there were lots of snacks and drinks, friends of theirs that I loved meeting and talking to, and even karaoke! While I was there, I was only focused on having fun and celebrating my friend’s birthday.

Last night while at the party, one of their friends (let’s call him Jacob) came up to a group I was with, and at some point interjected into the conversation with “If you think about it, clothing is consent.”

I was immediately floored. The party was emo themed so I had done myself up with makeup and was wearing a black miniskirt with fishnets over my legs. I immediately felt exposed. No one else in the group said anything, so I said “Actually, I think just consent is consent.”

The conversation got very quiet until someone else shifted to a different topic, but Jacob doubled down and said “Well you know, clothing is just covering.” He kept staring at me and I was getting extremely uncomfortable. Eventually it had become very obvious that he soured the mood, so he excused himself to go sit with some other guests by the fire pit. 

I told my friend about the interaction later that night, and they said that even though Jacob has always been consent oriented about everything he does, he does have mental health issues and tends to say inappropriate things at times. They said they would talk to him about it and I assumed the issue would be resolved later on. 

For the rest of the night I stayed around other people and made sure I could see him at all times. I’m actually staying with my friend for the weekend so I expected them to wrap up late, maybe around 1am and then we’d clean up the decorations and food, then go to bed.

It’s not until three hours later, at 4am, that I gave up and went to my friend’s room to lay down (we sleep in their room together every time I visit). I barely remembered them coming in to sleep, but by the time I woke up in the morning, they were gone.

I woke up at about 1pm, and went out to the living room to find that Jacob was still here with my friend and a few of their other friends playing some tabletop card game. My friend asked if I wanted to join upon seeing me in the hallway, so I sheepishly said “No!” and quickly went back to their room.

I feel bad for my friend because we’ve known each other for almost a decade and I really want to enjoy my time with them, but being around or near Jacob makes me feel immensely uncomfortable and I don’t want to give him any indications that I’m interested in him. I’m also transgender, so the thought of getting assaulted over my identity terrifies me. I’ve been catcalled and inappropriately touched in public before so the warning signs are already there in my mind.

"I(f20) work a fast food place as an assistant manager. There's quite a few managers, as we are one of the busiest places in the area and always need more staff. But out of the assistant managers, I tend to be the one picking up slack and properly training people. I always am the one approaching the staff about how to properly make food, how to clean, ect. 

A lot of the staff are teenagers in highschool and this is their first job, it is still mine too, and so approaching them I make sure I'm calm and explain to them everything I can. I break it down so they understand why we are doing things a certain way, especially when they express that they don't understand the point of putting a little less on food or needing to put more. 
The staff is great. Our store's manager works really hard to keep it that way, as she also recognizes that this job is a lot of people's first. Overall, the job is pretty relaxed and a fun environment. 

But, as of lately, we've been losing money on food costs from everyone overusing food, me included. So we've been retraining. I work everyday but one day a week, so a majority of this retraining is something I tool lead on. Some of the other managers help, mainly one other assistant and the store manager, but they can't work often at the same time everybody else can due to school and kids. 

The issue comes in when lately I've had one guy getting an attitude and being snappy towards me when I say things like ""Hey, that looks great, just add a little bit more there on the corner so it melts and covers it completely"" or little things like that. He keeps making comments like ""Oh you micromanage"" or little things like that but he's the only one whose expressed issues with me. 

And I'm sure it stems from me being the only person who will say that and not let little things slide everytime but I always work with another manager and he does. He doesn't back me up or speak up. He leaves his head down and ignores it. The store manager is aware and has tried talking to him but it never changes. She won't demote him or fire him for other reasons(who different story) but I think that his attitude makes the rest of the staff think they shouldn't listen to me, especially since he's older and has been there longer than me. 

Most of the staff takes well to me teaching them and telling them to adjust things they do, they all agree and say I'm never mean or rude when I say stuff to them but they do say my tone can be off, which I already know(I'm autistic and I have a pretty monotone voice and my tone tends to never change, everybody there knows this though). I just try my best to approach everybody kindly, praise what they're doing well and then just giving them tips on how to do even better. 

My store manager and I have spoken already about this, she said I'm not doing anything wrong. She said she's approached it the same way when she works around them.

"Repost from AITA

So I (18F) have been trying to save my ever falling apart family for a little while now and I've had a conversation about it with my bf today (18M) about it which has ended with an argument and him calling me an asshole.

As a bit of background, I live at home with my brother (16) while my parents marriage haven't been great. It all culminated in May/June time.

They had been arguing late into the night for months now, and during my final exams they were up to 4am fighting to the point I fell asleep mid exam and had to leave (I failed that subject lol). I yell at them and tell them to shut up frequently as it effects myself and my brother emotionally, and often one of them crying and apologising, promising they'll do better. They drink, argue and go for walks while shouting to not disturb us.

This happened and they went out, but when my dad returned cryingand my mum didn't. I'm like ""What the hell is happening"", and my dad explains my mum walked off about half an hour ago during the argument saying he was going to ""die in a ditch"". I left the house and had a run about the estate to look for her (It's like 2am) but couldn't find her.

When I get back, she's still not there, after calling I text her saying if she doesn't respond I'm calling the police. No response, so I phone the police. TLDR, they found her and my dad got arrested as it turns out mid fight he had hurt and was threatening her.

Since then, my previously close aunt and uncle have cut themselves off from the family because of it. And just learnt last night at work from my grandma that my mum had cut her off. I then get home from work at 12pm to find my mum completely plastered on the sofa. She's gone, like red wine spilt on the floor she didn't even notice, several empty bottles of wine about. I try taking her up to bed, but she's fallen backwards while stumbling and broke a desk landing on it.

I've just done a long, manual 16 hour shift and so I snapped my bf several videos of me just venting. The last months of this constant dealing with my drunk mum (she won't remember a lot of conversations we have) and arguments and trying to make amends with everyone and protecting my brother from the fighting is having a toll on me. I have BPD and noticed it's gotten a lot worse recently.

I called my bf to vent again this morning and he basically told me what was happening wasn't my business.

&lt;p&gt;So I (18F) have been trying to save my ever falling apart family for a little while now and I&amp;#39;ve had a conversation about it with my bf today (18M) about it which has ended with an argument and him calling me an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bit of background, I live at home with my brother (16) while my parents marriage haven&amp;#39;t been great. It all culminated in May/June time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had been arguing late into the night for months now, and during my final exams they were up to 4am fighting to the point I fell asleep mid exam and had to leave (I failed that subject lol). I yell at them and tell them to shut up frequently as it effects myself and my brother emotionally, and often one of them crying and apologising, promising they&amp;#39;ll do better. They drink, argue and go for walks while shouting to not disturb us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened and they went out, but when my dad returned cryingand my mum didn&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;What the hell is happening&amp;quot;, and my dad explains my mum walked off about half an hour ago during the argument saying he was going to &amp;quot;die in a ditch&amp;quot;. I left the house and had a run about the estate to look for her (It&amp;#39;s like 2am) but couldn&amp;#39;t find her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I get back, she&amp;#39;s still not there, after calling I text her saying if she doesn&amp;#39;t respond I&amp;#39;m calling the police. No response, so I phone the police. TLDR, they found her and my dad got arrested as it turns out mid fight he had hurt and was threatening her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, my previously close aunt and uncle have cut themselves off from the family because of it. And just learnt last night at work from my grandma that my mum had cut her off. I then get home from work at 12pm to find my mum completely plastered on the sofa. She&amp;#39;s gone, like red wine spilt on the floor she didn&amp;#39;t even notice, several empty bottles of wine about. I try taking her up to bed, but she&amp;#39;s fallen backwards while stumbling and broke a desk landing on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just done a long, manual 16 hour shift and so I snapped my bf several videos of me just venting. The last months of this constant dealing with my drunk mum (she won&amp;#39;t remember a lot of conversations we have) and arguments and trying to make amends with everyone and protecting my brother from the fighting is having a toll on me. I have BPD and noticed it&amp;#39;s gotten a lot worse recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called my bf to vent again this morning and he basically told me what was happening wasn&amp;#39;t my business. The drinking, the arguing, family falling out was all my fault and I was an asshole for ever &amp;quot;butting in&amp;quot;. Every time I got involved I was making the situation worse. He wasn&amp;#39;t kind about it , in the 3 years we&amp;#39;ve been together he&amp;#39;s never shouted at me, but today he did. Saying it was all my fault? That the marriage would be okay if I wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;in the way&amp;quot;. I kind of believe him. Maybe my dad wouldn&amp;#39;t have been arrested if I didn&amp;#39;t call the police? It&amp;#39;s really making me question everything. I know I&amp;#39;ll be told if I&amp;#39;m the asshole here so, am I?&lt;/p&gt;

"My (16f) younger half sister (15f) got a bad flu borderline pneumonia and was in the hospital for a the past two days. I hated her for being a copycat (she somehow idolises me) and admittedly didn't care about her.

I was glad she was gone at first but then I realised I missed having someone who looks at me like Im a celebrity, gives up her ice cream to me, and would finish my chores to please me.

I actually found it sweet that she drew me my favourite anime characters during her stay!

And she was back home and I was surprised that I was happy to see her. It was in the afternoon so I invited her to rebuild my minecraft world with me and I actually had fun! She is weird but quite cute.

After dinner she went back to her room to rest. Then at approximately 2am, I heard her having a coughing fit in her room so I brought her water and after it was over, I suggested us play games together in the living room. She happily said yes as long as the two of us wear masks like we did in the afternoon.

So I got carried away and we ended up playing and winning computer games together and truth or dared for the whole night. Also half sister didn't tell me she was tired and I didn't notice. Our mum found out about that when she saw how tired half sister was, and said I was inconsiderate to do that. Half sister got worse this morning.

"My younger sister is a high school freshman who is dating a junior in her school (or was, rather).

I got home one evening to hear them both arguing, and it sounded like she was crying. When I went upstairs to investigate I saw him put both of his hands on her and push her really hard, causing her to fall onto the floor. I immediately ran towards him and punched him in the face multiple times. He ended up with a black eye and his nose began bleeding. I told him to get the fuck out of the house and never come back and stay the fuck away from my sister, or I would do worse things to him. He complied.

He may only be a teenager, but he has inflicted physical and emotional harm directly upon a family member, so I think he unquestionably deserved what he got. I definitely think he was scared of me, since I turned 21 a few weeks ago and am considerably bigger than him. Hopefully he won't go near my sister or my family again, or I will make good on my promises.

My sister told me he had also slapped her earlier during their argument, so in my opinion that makes me beating him up even more justified.

"Me(16)fem and my best friend Max is (17) we have been best friends since third grade. We are in junior year now. (Contacts) My friend was overweight until 8th grade and then struggling with an eating disorder until freshman year. However, she’s a lot skinnier now, and no one ever talks about her weight.I wouldn’t consider myself overweight however, I do not have a flat stomach. Sophomore year, a girl started calling me fat in the middle of class. (Now with the story) my friend Max got upset because we where watching a movie in class. the girl who called me fat said that she thought the bear was fat(in the movie) and her and her friend started laughing hysterically. We head to our next class and in the next class we’re talking about body image. My friend Max starts talking to the bully and saying how she doesn’t like how she uses the word fat in a bad way. My friend Max then leaves and starts crying and I go to comfort her. I told her to ignore them and they’re pieces of shit. The bully then comes back and says there’s a misunderstanding my friend Max goes off on her saying that there’s no misunderstanding and she thinks that the bully is fat phobic. I agree with Max and I give her a high five. Later that day, I don’t have any other classes with Max however, what happens is that Max has several other interactions with the bully and  starts making fun of Max with the bully friends. Max asked another friend of ours to stand up for her and she does. Then the bully starts crying. Afterwards, max FaceTime is me and tells me what happened. Max then asked me if I will defend her the next time the bullies start making fun of her. I, say yes however, then Max asked me to interrogate the bully and tell the bully that what they say makes me uncomfortable, and I say no. I told Max if they say something to me about max to my face or if I hear about it, I’ll defend her, but I won’t start drama because I feel like it would make the situation worse. She get mad at me and then tell me that because we’re best friends, I should protect her no matter what and I do, I want to be able to protect her, but I also think if I go up and start harassing the bullies, I feel like it would make the situation worse I tried to explain this, but it doesn’t help Max then stops talking to me and some of my other friends to.

"Hi,

so I met this guy at a concert and he was very nice to me and he and his friends gave me a ride home after the concert. We interchanged Instagram and kept in touch. He didn't get a presale code to Taylor so I offered to buy him and a friend of his I never met two tickets. The other two people going are me and my best friend.

So far so good. I haven't heard from him since August, although I wrote him several messages, checking if he was okay. My friend and I would need to plan our stay since prices are going up for hotels and we know nothing from the acquaintance. He also doesn't update his Instagram, I don't have any other contact details. I don't know if he is going to show up again last minute or not.

I don't know if I should just transfer his money back and sell the tickets... My friend is between jobs, so I could actually pay for a part of her trip with the ticket money. We have been friends for 12 years now and I know I could help her this way. But then I feel very guilty about the guy.

There is just one problem; both sessions are on Sunday mornings. A lot of us, myself included, are Christians, and this poses a problem. We cannot miss services, so I feel like I should start a petition to change the in-service times to Sunday afternoon or some other time on the weekend, or even during the week.

" I  started a new job last year nd there were 4 other people who tarted at  the same time as me but only one of them was doing the same job as me.  Let's call her Rebecca. The job we to involves completing quite a few  exams over a few years so Rebecca and I would chat about exam tips and  revision as we were sitting the same exam. We work from home most of the  time so I have only actually met her 5 times in person.

We  get on well and I would class her as a friend. We message at work abotu  work and eam things and then talk about weekend plans, holiday plans  etc. We have each other on facebook but no other social media and have  only messaged throguh facebook 2 or 3 times and that was all exam and  work related.

I have never tried  to hide any of this from my girlfriend and when she asks about me day  I'll meention multiple colleagues. My girlfriend mentioned that she  thinks I talkto Rebecca too much and since my girlfriend and I both work  from home, she'll sarcastically ask if it is Rebecca messaging me when  my laptop makes a noise.

She said  she thinks I should talk to her less and I asked why and she just said  we're talking too much. I told her I don't tell her to stop talking to  people she works with so she shouldn't be doing it to me. She said I  should have no problem with it and should be fine doing it.

I  just repeated that I'm not going to be told who I can and can't talk  to. She accused me of not thinking of what hse's asking and just said  that she isn't exactly asking me for much.

We work from home most of the  time so I have only actually met her 5 times in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We  get on well and I would class her as a friend. We message at work abotu  work and eam things and then talk about weekend plans, holiday plans  etc. We have each other on facebook but no other social media and have  only messaged throguh facebook 2 or 3 times and that was all exam and  work related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never tried  to hide any of this from my girlfriend and when she asks about me day  I&amp;#39;ll meention multiple colleagues. My girlfriend mentioned that she  thinks I talkto Rebecca too much and since my girlfriend and I both work  from home, she&amp;#39;ll sarcastically ask if it is Rebecca messaging me when  my laptop makes a noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said  she thinks I should talk to her less and I asked why and she just said  we&amp;#39;re talking too much. I told her I don&amp;#39;t tell her to stop talking to  people she works with so she shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing it to me. She said I  should have no problem with it and should be fine doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  just repeated that I&amp;#39;m not going to be told who I can and can&amp;#39;t talk  to. She accused me of not thinking of what hse&amp;#39;s asking and just said  that she isn&amp;#39;t exactly asking me for much.&lt;/p&gt;

"The other night whilst in bed, out of curiosity, I asked my bf if he had an Instagram. He usually reads in bed so I rarely see him on his phone. He turned off his headlamp, put his book on the bedstand and said yeah. He handed me his phone with IG on screen so I could peruse. He mentioned that he’s not an active poster, more so a passive scroller. I looked at who he’s following and noticed a handful of them are attractive females. I brought this up to him and he said he follows them for the content—art, info, banal entertainment, etc. not just for their looks. 

They’re all extremely attractive. More than me and it makes me feel insecure. I told him this and he said they amount to nothing compared to me. I didn’t buy it and asked if he could unfollow them. He looked deflated, but agreed. 

Now I’m wondering if asking was too mean of me.

"Rejected from AITA so posting here.

I (32F) am in a friend group with ~10 people mostly around the same age. This is our main friend group that regularly hangs out together. The ladies also have a separate group chat and plan hangouts with just the 4-5 of us. This post is about one friend, Mary (44F). 

Mary is generally nice, but there are parts of Mary’s personality that are hard to deal with. She tends to push her opinion on people like she knows better, saying “I used to think like that when I was your age,” or “when you get to my age, you’ll see I’m right.” It normally just gets brushed it off “because she cares” but it can get frustrating when she won’t accept other people’s points of view. It’s just more negative than helpful most of the time. The worst was when she went off during a party and was yelling a friend in front of everyone for making a innocuous decision she didn’t agree with. 

Mary can also come across kind of self-centered. She’s made outrageous requests and put it on the receiver to say no (this may be ask- vs guess-culture but the group is very non-confrontational.) When a friend shares good news, she’s said something jaded, “trust me, you’ll see” kind of comment, or made it about herself (ex. a friend found a nice apartment and Mary complained there are too many stairs which will be hard on her knees.) It’s the negative vibe that really gets to me.

So last year, I briefly pulled away from the friend group. Half the incidents weren’t happening to me personally, but I hated being in a setting where other people won’t stand up for themselves. I tried encouraging our friends to talk to Mary but they said they’re not comfortable with that kind of confrontation or directness. 

Mary noticed my absence and messaged me, so I met up and had a candid talk with her. I explained my discomfort in the group dynamic and where her behaviour contributed. Mary said she wished more people would be direct with her because she can tell when it “feels weird”. I said not everyone is comfortable with that and I only told her because she asked me about it. After our talk, I did see some changes in Mary and I’ve since rejoined group activities as a result.

Recently, it seems Mary has slipped back into some old habits. So I made a new group chat with two other ladies, leaving out Mary. The reason is I truly don’t have the energy to have another big talk with Mary. Last time was so draining, and while she did seem to take what I said to heart, I have little hope now that she’s gone back to her old ways. Plus, the newer incidents seem to be worse than before and I want to protect my own energy.

Where I think I might be TB is that I personally have experienced the pain of being left out and it sucks. But I don’t want to include her out of obligation either. 

Note Mary is not being left out of any of the activities with the larger friend group. I am specifically asking AITB for having ladies-only hangouts without Mary.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-19T10:36:23.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejected from AITA so posting here.&lt;/p&gt;

"after a year of dating, my gf (32f) asked me (32m) to stop watching porn. she brought it up without context, while we were doing laundry and hanging out. i was surprised. we've never discussed porn before, and it's not really a part of my life. she said, ""if we're going to continue dating, i'm going to ask you to stop watching porn."" when i asked her why, she said that she felt uncomfortable about it, and that she's asked all her exes to do the same when they became serious. i told her i would need to think about it. she walked out of the room and we haven't talked about it since. i'm still confused by it, and suddenly feel like im on shaky ground after feeling like things were going smoothly.

not really sure what to do now. i wouldn't mind giving up porn, i barely watch it now as it is. at the same time, i don't like demands about what others do privately and by themselves, so i'm struggling with the idea of agreeing to it on principle. i'm also pretty frustrated that she waited a year to tell me.

"I'm a tenth grader and I was never inlove with someone. I was starting to think there was something seriously wrong with me. But then i switched schools due to not being fit for Mavo (dutch education) and went to a kader school when I met a very pretty Turkish girl. She is so cute. Loved sanrio and all that stuff. And some other things I really like. I kept my crush as a secret. Nobody knew. (Knew) but since I was new I didn't have friends. 

One day halfway into the school year a group of people from my class approached and asked if I wanted to be in their friend group. I said yes. And well we were friends. (That's not how it 100% went but how Is mostly irrelevant) few weeks later they advised me to download snapchat so I could get in a groupchat with them. Very convenient but they had a habit of talking dirty about girls in our class. Calling them ugly or how much they want to drink their breastmilk (yes really) 
This went on till our schooltrip to London

The girl I had a crush was slowly getting more friendly with me. Since I barely spoke to her  but it was going great.
However when we went back to the Netherlands for some reason she looked oddly upset? Cryish? No clue so my dumbass friends went under the assumption that she found out about how THEY talked dirty about her 
They knew I had a crush on her (forgot to mention after a few months they found out about my crush) they decided to throw me under a bus since it would look the most convincing. Well suddenly she was really upset at me through WhatsApp 

Obviously I had no clue what she was talking about and the next day I got a visit from her and her parents by my house. They were calm but I was still confused and they showed the snapchat messages from the other guys where they changed their name into mine 

I wanted to show them it wasn't me but they kept interrupting me  

Then I threatened to snitch them at school but they send some guy after me who literally threatened me with death if I switched them

Well than the summer break started and they kept pestering me. Telling everyone about what "" I did"" and everyone thought I was a disgusting creep. I'm not 

I was full of hatred so I decided to get back at their fatasses I told my friend who I knew was great with computers and stuff and send him their phones numbers afterwards he did is he traced down one of my backstabbing friends discord and added him. He became friends with him and bonded. You know what happend?? My friend catfished the backstabber 
meaning he was cheating on his real girlfriend. Obviously within a minute I told the girlfriend that her boyfriend was cheating so I sabatoged his relationship 

Obviously they found out my friend catfished him so they would break up 

 

TLDR I sabatoged my backstabbing friend relationship by having my real friend catfish him on discord 
I did this because he blamed me for something I didn't do and everyone thought I was a creep that photographed girls and talked creepy about them.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-19T10:52:43.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a tenth grader and I was never inlove with someone.

Throwaway account for privacy. Firstly a brief update on how the issue of her copying me ended up. I implemented a lot of your advice and it was quite helpful so thank you! Now I would recommend choices to my sister that are not the same as mine and she is happy with my recommendations!

I am 16f and her 15f.

However, she is still extremely clingy to me, which is annoying at best. She got sick with either the flu or a bad cold yesterday, which led to her staying in her room resting for extended periods of time. I won't say I am glad that she is sick, but I am definitely happy about it because I get to have a day unbothered by her.

So today our mum is at her best friend's wedding and her dad is unfortunately having a busy time at work that is would be really unideal for his team for him to take a day off work.

We don't have school today, so the two of us are left at home. Our mum texted me to ask if I need to check on my sister, so I texted my sister (she is in her room) so ask if she needs me to check on her. She said not necessarily and she didn't want to infect me as well, so fair enough I just left it and made myself lunch.

When our mum came home, she asked me if my sister has eaten or took medicine. I replied that I don't know as she said it is not necessary for me to check on her, and showed her the texts for proof.

Mum said I was being hostile and uncaring, but I don't have to care about my sister right? Especially when she is a pestering brat.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-17T12:03:02.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account for privacy.

&lt;p&gt;Mum said I was being hostile and uncaring, but I don&amp;#39;t have to care about my sister right? Especially when she is a pestering brat.&lt;/p&gt;

"I (F26) and my bf (M25) have been in a relationship for about 7 years now, and we have been living togeyher for 6. All in all, I love him. He has very VERY few quirks that just drive me insane. But there is one, he likes to rant. A lot. Mainly about politics, and it usually starts when he watches a video of a podcast where two men are bickering or having a debate over hot topics today.

Nornally, I don't mind listening to him if he has anxiety over these things happening, that's one thing. But when he goes to ranting, he will start and won't stop. He doesn't even need a reply from me, he'll just keep going. 

It doesn't matter if I'm doing my own thing or not, he'll just pause his video and start ranting about how this guy is wrong, or how people are awful because of this or that, etc. He says he doesn't rant at me, he just rants to rant, but he will be looking right at me and pause in between his ""points"" like he's expecting a reply from me. I feel like a butt face if I don't give him one. 

I don't listen to politics or subject myself to topics that I know will cause a fire in me, so I don't like it when a fire is ignited in him and I'm the one feeling the heat from it. Like jfc.

"There is this jerk in my class called Chris. He’s always bothering me and my mates and making fun of us. My friends are Alex and Kim, and us 3 never bother him but he hates us.

Chris has a girlfriend, Haley. Me and my friends are really good friends with Haley. Haley is really nice and cool. I don’t know what the fuck Chris did to deserve her, but whatever. If Haley wants to be with Chris, sure. I’m pretty sure Chris doesn’t even care about Haley as a person. He just cares about her because of her looks.

Now Chris, you see, has a problem with me being friends with Haley. He always hated us, gave us cold looks all the time, made rude remarks, spread rumours about me and my mates but it was when I became friends with Haley that verbal bullying escalated to physical bullying.

Haley is a good person but a bit of a wuss. (Sorry but it’s true). She doesn’t like Chris to be mean to us and gets upset but never really stands up for us.)

So here’s where the conflict happened. It was my birthday and wanted to do something small so invited Alex, Kim and Haley. Chris didn’t know about this (well bro, what do you think I’m going to do, text him and ask if it’s okay for me to invite his girlfriend over for my birthday?).

So they came and we had loads of fun. My parents weren’t home that evening and they’d be getting home really late, but they let me do this.

By 11pm, Alex and Kim left because it was getting late, and I spent a few hours hanging out with Haley. She looked at her phone at one point and said she had lots of missed calls from Chris, and he was getting angry with her, so she should go. I asked her why (like what’s that urgent?) and she just said Chris does that. I was confused but didn’t question it.

But then I heard angry knocking on my door and the doorbell was ringing loads of times. I opened the door and Chris just came in and shut the door and started yelling and swearing at me. I was really scared and Haley seemed scared as well. (By the way, I found out later that the reason why Chris knew Haley was at my house was that he can track her phone. Haley is fine with this for some reason?)

I suddenly stopped feeling scared and just felt angry. I told him to get out of my house and that I’ll call the police. He was laughing, threatening me, saying he could fight me easily. I said fine fight me. Haley was trying to get Chris to stop, but I told her to fuck off and that she had done enough damage all this time by not standing up for me.

And so I fought Chris. Ended up with a black eye, bleeding nose and was punched in the gut, but I really hurt him, and he ended up on the floor screaming telling me to stop and that he’d leave me alone. He was actually scared of me. It was kinda funny.

He left my house and so did Haley. When my parents came back they were really angry with me and also furious with my school for doing nothing about all this and not putting a stop to the bullying. Haley and Chris made a whole fuss and told the whole school a twisted version of what happened. Now everyone’s taking Chris’ side.

I think Chris was really pissed at Haley. But Chris hasn’t bothered me at all since then! But Haley hasn’t spoken to me either. I texted her asking why she’s not speaking to me and she said it was way out of line what I did. I say it’s way out of line how your boyfriend treats me, and how he treats you as well, and that I can’t believe you’d say that. Haley said Chris respects her and loves her (bruh what?). So now she hates me, because apparently I ‘initiated’ the fight. Yes, I said fight me, but only because HE STORMED INTO MY HOUSE. THAT’S TRESSPASSING. AND HAS BEEN BULLYING ME FOR YEARS.

So AITB?

"A few nights ago I was walking home with my girlfriend, when this asshole on a bike pulls up next to us and starts cat calling my girlfriend, like doing the obnoxious whistling and shit. He looked to be similar to our age (we are both in our early 20s) - and definitely wasn't acting like it.

He circled around us on his bike and continued to harass us and said things at my girlfriend that progressively got more disgusting - things that I will not repeat here. I don't know who on earth taught him it was okay to do that.

When he rode towards us again, I grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him off the bike onto the ground. He fell on his side and laid on the ground groaning in pain. My girlfriend gasped but I just calmy said to leave him there and he got what he deserved. We continued walking while he lay there groaning like the baby he is.

When we got home, my girlfriend told me that I probably shouldn't have done that to him. I told her that he was being predatory towards her and I was defending her, and that I thought she would understand. She said that she did understand but I still shouldn't have gotten physical because what if he was stronger than me and fought back.

I (16f) miss life without my annoying younger half-sister (15f).

She is not only a copycat and annoying, to which I always get the unempathetic ""imitation is the highest form of flattery"" nonsense, she also seems to have a knack in making adults think badly about me.

Like how I got called uncaring when I have done what I am asked to do--- check in on her. She has been quite badly sick and both parents have important stuff to do, so fine I did by saying ""is it absolutely necessary for me to check in on you"" via text with her replying "" No I don't want to infect you"", so I took it as a no and didn't. Like its logical right? Like she got to be the ""kind girl"" while I got painted as ""uncaring"".

Just then I discovered that my food is used up and all my animals gone in my minecraft account. After investigating it turns out to be my annoying sister using my account with the shared PC in the living room. She tried to be a ""good girl"" and explained that she wanted to gain new animals, materials and different food to give me a surprise.

She said she learnt how to do that online, but it has gone wrong. I was so furious that my gaming materials are gone that I yelled at her to get the fuck out of my life. I instructed her to avoid each other with me so that it would be closer to the truth. I might have been too harsh because she was quite upset and was pretending to be a nice sister by telling our mum that she is not upset. But I know who she is.

" I (17f) live with three other siblings and two parents. I've never really posted anything like this before, but I feel like I'm losing my mind over what's been happening for the past few years. I was very physically affectionate as a kid, but something began to change and I don't quite know when. It was small at first. It would be like a twist in my stomach whenever I touched anyone, but overtime it became more like a punch to the gut. I ignored it for a long time. I would push it aside in my head and think nothing of it. However, my reactions became more severe. I started hyperventilating with prolonged contact, I felt like I couldn't breath, I could hear my heartbeat in my head, and all I could think about was running. My family has come to learn this about me and they were accommodating, but my mother was different. She would sit me down and refuse to let me leave until I ""Stopped being so dramatic"". When I didn't, she would continue to poke and prod me to gage my reaction. At one point, she even threatened to ""hold me like the baby I was being"". All I could do was beg her to stop touching me. Of course, she didn't, and I just continued screaming, crying, and begging. In the clarity that follows, I'm genuinely embarrassed and confused. I truly don't know why I do this, and I don't know how to stop it. I have avoided most physical contact ever since, but there are still incidents I have with my mother who doesn't seem to care. Whenever it happens I'm just called selfish, cold-hearted, a crybaby, dramatic, unloving, and rude. I love her, and I wish that she didn't need a hug to see it. No matter how many times I try to explain to her that I just don't like being touched, she continues trying. She'll back me into corners and try to force it on me. When I react, she laughs. When it persists, she calls me names and says that I'm trying to do things ""my way"" instead of just giving her this. I can understand where she's coming from. I'm her daughter, she's my mother, and it's just a hug right? Rationally speaking, I agree. I just can't explain or control that sickening feeling when I touch anyone. High fives, holding hands, hand shakes, hugs, you name it and I can't do it. Any attempt on my part just leaves me scratching at my skin. I told myself that maybe more exposure would help. Then I realized that there was one person I could touch without as harsh a reaction, and it's my little sister who's five. Unfortunately, she is the only one. After seeing this, my mother began to believe that I'm lying and am using this as an excuse to treat her badly. I just want to know if I'm the one who's in the wrong here. At least, all of my family members have witnessed this firsthand, but they side with my mother. The only reason I think I may be right is that my other sister would stand up for me and bail me out in some situations. This fact has lead me to finally reach out to the reddit community (for the sake of anonymity) to find out. AITB?

I would push it aside in my head and think nothing of it. However, my reactions became more severe. I started hyperventilating with prolonged contact, I felt like I couldn&amp;#39;t breath, I could hear my heartbeat in my head, and all I could think about was running. My family has come to learn this about me and they were accommodating, but my mother was different. She would sit me down and refuse to let me leave until I &amp;quot;Stopped being so dramatic&amp;quot;. When I didn&amp;#39;t, she would continue to poke and prod me to gage my reaction. At one point, she even threatened to &amp;quot;hold me like the baby I was being&amp;quot;. All I could do was beg her to stop touching me. Of course, she didn&amp;#39;t, and I just continued screaming, crying, and begging. In the clarity that follows, I&amp;#39;m genuinely embarrassed and confused. I truly don&amp;#39;t know why I do this, and I don&amp;#39;t know how to stop it. I have avoided most physical contact ever since, but there are still incidents I have with my mother who doesn&amp;#39;t seem to care. Whenever it happens I&amp;#39;m just called selfish, cold-hearted, a crybaby, dramatic, unloving, and rude. I love her, and I wish that she didn&amp;#39;t need a hug to see it. No matter how many times I try to explain to her that I just don&amp;#39;t like being touched, she continues trying. She&amp;#39;ll back me into corners and try to force it on me. When I react, she laughs. When it persists, she calls me names and says that I&amp;#39;m trying to do things &amp;quot;my way&amp;quot; instead of just giving her this. I can understand where she&amp;#39;s coming from. I&amp;#39;m her daughter, she&amp;#39;s my mother, and it&amp;#39;s just a hug right? Rationally speaking, I agree. I just can&amp;#39;t explain or control that sickening feeling when I touch anyone. High fives, holding hands, hand shakes, hugs, you name it and I can&amp;#39;t do it. Any attempt on my part just leaves me scratching at my skin. I told myself that maybe more exposure would help. Then I realized that there was one person I could touch without as harsh a reaction, and it&amp;#39;s my little sister who&amp;#39;s five. Unfortunately, she is the only one. After seeing this, my mother began to believe that I&amp;#39;m lying and am using this as an excuse to treat her badly. I just want to know if I&amp;#39;m the one who&amp;#39;s in the wrong here. At least, all of my family members have witnessed this firsthand, but they side with my mother. The only reason I think I may be right is that my other sister would stand up for me and bail me out in some situations. This fact has lead me to finally reach out to the reddit community (for the sake of anonymity) to find out. AITB? &lt;/p&gt;

"So I (15f) and my mom (34f) have had a strained relationship since about june of 2020. She and her now fiancé (34M) fight every single day. Yelling and screaming and hitting one another. We are also relatively poor, to the point that some nights i go without food. My cousins don't like this and so sometimes they give me money. I went and bought food for myself and refused to give my mom some because it's all I'd eaten in 4 days. My step dad started screaming at me. He called me useless and said I should move out. But finally, he said something that pushed me over the edge. He said he was going to withhold food from me in total. And won't buy me necessities. So I texted my cousin and told her about it. They started screaming at me for it. Saying that I'm an asshole for saying that my mom and him don't take care of me when they quite literally don't. They yell at me every day now because of this all. I'm just trying to help me and my older sister (17f) from not getting food or stuff like that. So please, AITB??

UPDATE: I just found out my mom and step dad have been feeding my older sister, but not me. Today is the first day in almost a week I've eaten at home. My mom and step dad buy my sister different fast food places for breakfast and lunch every day. but cant/won't for me. Despite working closer to my high school rather than my sister.

"Like most kids, I would sometimes start singing at completely inappropriate times.  One of those inappropriate times was at the grocery store.  I would sing the SpongeBob Squarepants theme song, as well as other theme songs from various cartoons, at the top of my lungs.  Eventually, my parents made a rule ""No singing in stores!""

&amp;#x200B;

One day when I was about seven or eight years old, I was in the grocery store, when I heard a lady singing.  I didn't understand context very well as a kid, and so I didn't understand the difference between her singing to soothe her fussy baby, and me singing various songs just because.  This being the case, I told the lady off.  I marched right up to her, pointed my finger at her, and loudly said ""It's bad to sing in stores!""

&amp;#x200B;

""Say you're sorry right now!"" my mom ordered.

&amp;#x200B;

""But it's bad to sing in stores!"" I protested.

&amp;#x200B;

""Say it right now or no dessert tonight!"" my mom ordered me again.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sorry I said it's bad to sing in stores even though it's bad."" I said to the lady.

"I am part of an engineering club at my college and I know this other member who is, quite frankly, really fucking annoying. He is always talking about his grades and his work habits, boasting about shit like staying up late to get more homework done. I've also noticed that he likes to impose his opinions on other people a lot, and has told other people that their opinions or outlooks on life are wrong if they're not the same as his. Talk about being a douchebag. I would be totally fine with the way he lives his life if he would just shut his mouth and not make it his entire personality, but he does not.

And then recently, he got a girlfriend and boasted multiple times about how she was the one who made the first move and asked him out and blah blah blah. I've never met her but I feel bad for her choosing to date a jerk like him and not seeing the red flags.

Our club meets on Friday evenings, and last Friday he and I were both there and he was doing his usual thing. I've finally reached the point where I've had enough of his stupid inflated ego, so I got in his face and said, ""Will you stop being such an insufferable arrogant shit?!""

He looked at me surprised and asked what my problem was. I told him that all he does is talk about himself and his achievements like a self-absorbed jerkass, and that somebody had to take him down a notch. He said I was being an asshole and that I should take a step back and think over what I had said. I said, ""No, fuck you. I've been waiting a long time to say what I said to you and you deserve it. Oh, and speaking of what you deserve, your girlfriend wouldn't be one of those. See you around, bitch.""

And I immediately got up and left before he could say anything - with a smirk on my face, I might add - because I didn't want to be around him for another second after rightfully putting him in his place. I know I definitely won't be going to that club anymore too.

"My(26F) BF(24M) has been recently hanging out with a trans woman(Rose) from my class, turns out they have a lot in common with one another as they are into the same set of hobbies, my bf doesn't have much friends who are into the same things as him and for him to make friends with Rose has been a really nice change until recently, I have been facing the bad side of it.

As of late my BF and Rose have been going out every week, they spend time in arcades or local hobby shops, my bf would turn off his phone or leave it at home(he always does these things) and it makes me uneasy, that's not the only thing that bothers as Rose has gotten really close to him to the point she hugs and goes to him for emotional support, I'm not kidding I would come home and they would be watching a movie or playing video games together. my friends assume that my bf is cheating on me with rose and that I should dump him before it's too late. 

Instead I decided to confront my bf and ask him about rose and if he is gay now, he just apologies for making me worry and explain to me he never had a best friend like her(they both have been hated their whole life for being a little different) so it makes sense he would get a little carried away with spending time with them. regardless of their similar experiences it still makes me uneasy.

I decided to put my foot down and end their friendship before it ruins my relationship, I forbid my bf from talking to her because I don't want them to become intimate, bf got confused and sighed telling me he finally had a friend after so long and I'm making him get rid of her.

"So my friend/coworker accused me of stealing

I (28M) work at Old Navy. I started 7 years ago. I been there off and on. I came back recently.I have known this manager for years. We have a long history and I have considered them a close friend.

I had old pair of Old Navy underwear in my gym bag I brought to work. I had it because after work i workout and sometimes I change. and I also have a personal private medical issue for having them.

(Someone in the comments got mad at me for saying it. so i’m not going to say my medical issue. But just know it’s legit. and if i could say it you’d understand why)

We are allowed to have purchased items from our brand at our store. The policy is that you just have to have a proof you bought it. Which I did and could have easily provided. So I did everything according to the rules. and HR confirmed it for me

everytime someone leaves work they have to have their bag checked. and i told her beforehand “hey tmi but i have old Old Navy underwear in my bag you might see. But I can prove they were bought”.

But no she pauses. Looks at me so nasty. she genuinely looked at me like I just stole. why would i show her the item i’m stealing?

I’ll never forget the look on her face. She jumped to the immediate conclusion that I stole. She didn’t give it a second thought. As if all these 7 years she’s known me meant nothing.

in the a judgmental tone she says “Why do you have these underwear in your bag”

I said “this is my gym bag and sometimes i like to change. I can provide the proof of emailed receipt and that they were bought long ago”. 

she then says “but why are they Old Navy brand”

which keep in mind she doesn’t need to be asking at all. All managers need is the receipt to prove they were bought. Which she didn’t ever ask for. Also I have my medical issue I couldn’t say that in front of customers and associates near by

I can tell she still thinks i’m stealing and I say “I’ll show you the proof that they are old” and she refuses

She still DOESNT believe me.

she then says “well just never bring those into work again” which isn’t correct. We allowed to have our brand in our store.

I leave and I’m completely heartbroken. Imagine someone you’ve known for 7 years. Through ups and downs. Someone you thought genuinely believed in you and cared. Genuinely thought that you’d do something like that. At your own job 

I went home. I looked up the receipts for the pair. sent all the proof to her

I immediately called HR the next day. They confirmed that she was 100% inappropriate. She told me “you are 100% allowed to have underwear in your bag. you could have 10 pairs but all you’d need is the receipt. Which you had”

I blocked her on social media and quit. But I feel bad because maybe she was just doing her job as a manager. I rarely get mad at people like this. But I can’t believe she would even think that was in my character. After 7 years? After all the stuff i’ve been through?

"My gf of 3 months and I went on a 2-week-long vacation together. The flight back was delayed. We were supposed to land at 21:00 and we landed at like 22:40-22:45 or so.

To get home, I take a train from the airport, it takes under 10 mins, I’m very close. The last trains were at 23:00 and 23:30. My gf needs to take a train and a bus, it normally takes her about half an hour, but she told me she would just get a taxi since she feels unsafe in the area where she has to change and she doesn’t wanna run after trains and buses. We weren’t planning to go both to mine or her place because the next day we needed to be at the office and each of us lives right next to their workplace.

Once we landed, I said that once they open the doors I will run to the train station so I could make it to the train at 23:00. My gf seemed bothered, she didn’t say anything and said everything was fine, but I could tell. 

It took a long time until they let us out, I didn’t run and waited with her until she got herself a taxi, then waited for my last train for about 10 mins and went home.

We weren’t planning to go both to mine or her place because the next day we needed to be at the office and each of us lives right next to their workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we landed, I said that once they open the doors I will run to the train station so I could make it to the train at 23:00. My gf seemed bothered, she didn’t say anything and said everything was fine, but I could tell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a long time until they let us out, I didn’t run and waited with her until she got herself a taxi, then waited for my last train for about 10 mins and went home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AITB if I would have run? Or simply for wanting to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

"I work at a liquor store and this man came in to buy beer. His purchase came to 19.69. After I scan his points card he hands me 10 cash and tells me in a mumbled tone to “take 10 off.” 

Because I didn’t hear him mention redeeming any points at this point and he said this to me while physically handing me 10 dollars cash I assumed he meant he wanted to pay 10 cash and the rest card. 

Turns out he wanted to redeem 10 dollars in points and pay the rest cash. At this point I’ve already put the 10 through in cash and tell him the remaining is 9.69. At this point he becomes super condescending and says he wanted to redeem. I tell him I can only redeem in increments of 10 dollars and since I’ve already but the 10 through in cash the remaining is under that. He says in a super harsh and rude tone to “well do it again then.” At this point I’m already peeved he’s blaming me for his lack of communication but I begin voiding the transaction to do it again.

I probably should not have said this next thing, I understand it was a bit unprofessional but I was growing sick of his attitude and unwillingness to take responsibility for his part in the miscommunication.

 I told him “if you wanted to redeem you should’ve told me before handing me cash.” He claims he did but all I heard from him at that point was to “take 10 off.” If he really DID mention points it was not audible to me because he was mumbling and dismissive. I told him I did not hear him mention points and he needs to speak up. At this point he raises his voice and says “look just do your job!” 

At this point I told him I would not serve him if he was going to be disrespectful to me. I told him to take the 10 and leave and he did. 

It’s hard to explain on here how rude he was because tonality cannot be communicated through text well.
He was overall very condescending, degrading and had a very entitled and stuck up attitude.  He was treating me like I was stupid for misunderstanding what he wanted when he arguably didn’t communicate effectively enough on his end. Like I’m not a mind reader. How am I supposed to know he wanted to redeem if he was telling me to take 10 off while handing me 10 cash and not audibly mentioning points. 

 Like misunderstandings happen and all but I’ve never had a customer be that disrespectful to me even when the mistake or miscommunication was on my part. I understand I was a bit unprofessional on my end and would’ve handled it a bit differently if I could go back in time but I also do not want to tolerate being disrespected.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-16T03:44:30.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work at a liquor store and this man came in to buy beer.

"I recently started therapy and it has been worth the time. My therapist frequently texts me asking how I've been. I feel it's normal for him to check on me because I told him I have anxiety, so I assumed what he's doing is part of his job. But this is where things started being suspicious for me.

He's the only person in the entire clinic, he just runs it from a small space. I went in there looking at the Google reviews, and also because he's the only person near my home, I had to choose him because I was going without my parents' knowledge, and I could lie to parents saying I'm going for a walk and visit him.

First, my therapist kept texting me for a few days to give him a 5-star review on Google. I really wouldn't give him 5 stars because even though his service was good, he often kept boasting about how searching on Google for the best therapist in Chennai would bring up his name on the top. I believe that being in the top in any profession isn't necessary, just putting your heart in what you do will make you happy. So, I gave 4 stars and posted a review, but he again texted me to make it 5 stars.

Second, he always expects an immediate response from me every time he texts. I often tend to miss chats when I'm busy with some other things or I go out. This time, I went to an audition on Sunday, he texted me how it went but I didn't reply to his texts the very next day itself as I had guests over and some work too. He immediately texted asking ""Did you go out of town or something? Where's the reply?""

Third but mainly, I recently changed my profile picture to a funny photo of Taylor Swift on my WhatsApp (I do not keep my own photo as my profile for privacy), but I forgot to change my about. In that, I had written ""head feels heavy because of thoughts"" because I had taken my previous profile photo (that of a cat resting its head on a table) with the above text as a caption. My therapist proceeded to take a screenshot of it, and then texts me that along with words saying, ""I am there, no need to worry, okay?""

For me, looking at my profile picture and status to find clues all come under breach of my privacy. Even though my therapist has the right to know how I feel, using other means to understand my mental state according to me, sounds like crossing my boundaries.

So, is my therapist breaching my privacy? Or is this how therapists usually are? Should I try letting him know that he might be crossing the limit or something? I'm from India, where mental health is still a stigma and us people are only slowly opening to accepting it as important, so I'm guessing the therapist might be using this as an advantage to defend himself and his actions.

EDIT: Since most of you insisted I post a negative review for him, I also wanted to share another red flag. Here are the links to screenshots of his replies to negative reviews.

"Sorry if this doesn't belong here, but here it goes. I'm a 16 year old teenager, and my old friend, let's call them Ron and I had a massive fight before we ended our secondary school last winter. We were both shitty to each other during this period of my life and I had something going on in my own head that made me numb of basic emotions and the feeling of guilt. I didn't mean to hurt Ron in any way, that's not who I am as a person. I try to be kind to people and I'm a very shy person, I don't like to confront people. Not going into the details of the fight, but they spiralized my eating disorder and I talked shit about them to my friends, again, not to ruin Ron's reputation but to talk about my feelings. I had a crush on Ron at the time and he went into a relationship all of a sudden after us kissing at school and being all lovey dovey. I got jealous and he took it as if I was mad at him for finding a partner. I lashed out to them after Ron broke up with their partner at the time and became even colder towards me and everyone else in the friend group of that time. Then we made up and everything was alright for a while. Then we got into another fight over the summer after we got out of 9th grade. We haven't talked since. Today, 14.11.2023, I went to a tour to a different school, to see what's it like in that line of work. Ron is a student there. He gave me dirty looks every now and then, I tried to ignore him. Earlier today, around 9 am, I sent him a long text, apologizing about my actions towards him. They ignored the text for most of the day, fair enough, he was busy, then I suddenly get a text from Ron's boyfriend, we can call him ""Fan"". Fan is from a different state, he doesn't understand my language, we speak english. He came to me to ask me to not say anything bad to Ron, again, fair enough, I did shitty things in the past. I understand that the trust they have on me is non-existant. I got anxious, because I wanted this thing to be between me and Ron. Me and Fan talked for a while, and I tried to explain why I had contacted Ron in the first place. Then Fan became unnesseserally mean towards me and said that ""I don't need tl repeat words"". I repeated to him two times about me wanting to let Ron know that I'm sorry. And kept apologizing because it was eating me alive to know that I hurt someone who was once dear to me. Then when I was leaving the campus with my friend and teacher Ron came to me and asked what I wanted to talk about. I explaines the text to him and he just said ""cool, bye"" and left. Then when I was on my way to pick up my friend Ron texted me that he wants nothing to do with me, I understood that. Then he started lashing out about me ""finally realizing"" that I hurt him. I had realized it a while ago but was too scared to contact Ron. Then I said that I complitely do understand that he doesn't want to be in contact and he said. ""Glad you are capable of empathy"" and blocked me. I feel shitty, I can't sleep.

I had a crush on Ron at the time and he went into a relationship all of a sudden after us kissing at school and being all lovey dovey. I got jealous and he took it as if I was mad at him for finding a partner. I lashed out to them after Ron broke up with their partner at the time and became even colder towards me and everyone else in the friend group of that time. Then we made up and everything was alright for a while. Then we got into another fight over the summer after we got out of 9th grade. We haven&amp;#39;t talked since. Today, 14.11.2023, I went to a tour to a different school, to see what&amp;#39;s it like in that line of work. Ron is a student there. He gave me dirty looks every now and then, I tried to ignore him. Earlier today, around 9 am, I sent him a long text, apologizing about my actions towards him. They ignored the text for most of the day, fair enough, he was busy, then I suddenly get a text from Ron&amp;#39;s boyfriend, we can call him &amp;quot;Fan&amp;quot;. Fan is from a different state, he doesn&amp;#39;t understand my language, we speak english. He came to me to ask me to not say anything bad to Ron, again, fair enough, I did shitty things in the past. I understand that the trust they have on me is non-existant. I got anxious, because I wanted this thing to be between me and Ron. Me and Fan talked for a while, and I tried to explain why I had contacted Ron in the first place. Then Fan became unnesseserally mean towards me and said that &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t need tl repeat words&amp;quot;. I repeated to him two times about me wanting to let Ron know that I&amp;#39;m sorry. And kept apologizing because it was eating me alive to know that I hurt someone who was once dear to me. Then when I was leaving the campus with my friend and teacher Ron came to me and asked what I wanted to talk about. I explaines the text to him and he just said &amp;quot;cool, bye&amp;quot; and left. Then when I was on my way to pick up my friend Ron texted me that he wants nothing to do with me, I understood that. Then he started lashing out about me &amp;quot;finally realizing&amp;quot; that I hurt him. I had realized it a while ago but was too scared to contact Ron. Then I said that I complitely do understand that he doesn&amp;#39;t want to be in contact and he said. &amp;quot;Glad you are capable of empathy&amp;quot; and blocked me. I feel shitty, I can&amp;#39;t sleep. Please people, AITB?&lt;/p&gt;

" I (18M) currently live with my parents and grandparents in my grandparents house. I sometimes get tasked with running errands for the family to make things easier on my grandparents and my parents. We aren't very poor, just not in a great situation at the moment (would explain more but there's a character limit). My dad makes decent money, or at least enough to survive in the tax-hell that is NJ. My mom is unemployed, despite having the best education. She tutors and teaches here and there for different co-op schools, as well as tutors my brothers. I have been working as a unpaid creative consultant for a local radio host, working at a local ice cream shop, and volunteering at my grandmother's store as a thank you for letting us stay with them. During this time I am also taking college classes online as well as one in-person class (film major). As of writing this, the ice cream season is over so I am currently out of work and looking for a job.

Today I went to visit a friend at work. When I got home, my mother told me that the bag of chocolate chips she had bought from the grocery store had a hole in it, and the chips inside were covered in white shavings. My brother also needed a book for his class, one that needed to be read by tomorrow, and a friend had on hand for us to borrow. I offered to get both of the items, saving my mom the trip. She gave me five dollars for the chocolate chips and we were on our way.

I think it's also important to note that me and my parents don't agree politically, me being a more liberal person and my parents and grandparents being on the more conservative end of things.

My brother wanted to buy Nestle brand chips, which I did not want to do. As any redditor or liberal knows, Nestle has a long history of fucked up shit and I did not want to contribute that. I grabbed the ghirardelli chips, which were only one dollar and fifty cents more. On the way home, I tried explaining to my brother why I didn't want to buy Nestle, but he was reluctant to understand.

At home, my mom flipped out on me for buying the more expensive chocolate chips. It got so out of hand that she cracked jokes about my intelligence, accused me of having a spending problem and abusing my father's money, and that my politics get in the way of the family all the time. When I asked when I have ever abused my family's funds, she brought up a memory from when I was fourteen and spent more than what I was allowed when stopping for snacks at Wawa. She ended her rant by telling me she has never trusted me with any task regarding money since that incident, and she said she has to ""practically spoon feed"" me whenever she sends me out on an errand. After a year and a half of driving and a year of living with my grandparents, this was the first I had ever heard of this.

" 

I am 14f and my sister, 12f has recently died from a road accident.

Initially after hearing the news I was actually thrilled to hear that, which I am not proud of. I am over the moon for myself but also felt sad for my parents' grief. That's why I played along about how sad it is, while I don't feel that way.

I know it sounds horrible to be happy for someone's death, please hear me out.

My sister had been a horrible, vindictive bully to me. It has been going on since we were little, but has only exacerbated over the years. My parents tried giving her consequences at first but she defied so badly against it it caused my parents a lot of trouble, which led to them giving up.

I have had vivid memories since I was four; I know this is unusual but this is me.

Starting from the time when she was four and I was six, she would wind me up when our parents weren't aware and make me whine seemingly from no reason when our parents come back. And put on an angelic face when my parents come and deny everything. Please note that then she was an obedient child while I was the imaginative one in the eyes of adults, so my parents believed her.

A year later, she got into the habit of stealing and damaging the stuff I value, like my favourite stationary, craft paper, etc. She tried very cunningly to get away from it but she was caught time to time.

Around that time she had also been mean to me verbally, starting from critisizing me for everything I do when she was seven, to actual name-calling a few years later and the last three years had been hell living with her literally 24/7 berating me, making me feel like the worst person in the world. (calling me rubbish and useless and verbally attack me every single day)

She gets physical with me if I don't comply to her unreasonable requests, like not helping her carry her stuff while she fire personal attacks at me. I usually retaliate by holding her hands so that she doesnt further hurt me, and both of us would get in trouble. In this cases I don't get in trouble if my parents witness it but when they arent I would so the logical explanation is that she has been manipulative in some ways.

In between this bullying, she always has a small treat for me and present it to me, making sure that they know and then take it back. My parents were convinced that she loved me.

Every single time when she is sick with something contagious she would try her best to infect me, like deliberately coughing at me, talking to me like 1cm away from my face in a way that her saliva flies into me. She was once caught spitting into my cup of water when sick. She got into trouble for that from parents and I got into even bigger trouble from her.

Meanwhile she accused me of bullying for avoiding her to avoid abuse being fired at me.

I have noticed that in community where people know her I have far less friends and people who originally liked me disliked me after knowing her. But it might be a coincidence.

My mum has noticed that and isn't too happy with me (understandably). AITB?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-14T09:50:06.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 14f and my sister, 12f has recently died from a road accident.&lt;/p&gt;

"Last night, my (18f) parents both left the city on business trip, leaving me to take care of my younger brothers Richard and Keith (10 and 13 respectively). I'm currently on university break, so I wouldn't have to worry about leaving on time to go to my university and getting Richard to school on time. While this wouldn't be the first time my parents left us alone to go on a business trip, this is the first time they left us home alone for more than a day.

After sending Richard to school, I had pretty much the house to myself for the day and took a nap. I noticed that Keith forgot to take his ADHD meds before he went to school. I wasn't there to make him take it since he left long before I woke up. However, as soon as he came back from school, he immediately asked where Dad keeps his credit cards before he remembered and went into Dad's office to get it. I was half-awake when this happened. I asked what he needed it for.

He claimed that he wanted to buy Robux for the game Roblox and ran out of the room with the card. I asked if he asked Dad and he said no. I was shocked and tried to stop him but I had to go to the bathroom, so I texted Dad telling him what Keith told me. He replied saying that he'd call him. I ran downstairs and heard him and Dad talking. It turned out that he lied about not asking Dad for permission and buying Robux; he just wanted KFC and asked Dad beforehand.

I was livid. I demanded to know why he lied, and he said he did it to piss me off. I was more mad about being lied than if he had actually bought something without Dad's permission. I told him off for how irresponsible that was of him, how if he kept that up, I may never trust him again, and if he wanted to make huge decisions, he needs to run it through me since I was in charge until our parents came back. He acted like I was blowing things out of proportion, it was just a dumb joke, and he didn't need to listen to me because I'm not his mom.

After I calmed down 10 minutes later, I figured that he might've did that because he didn't take his meds this morning so I had him take it soon. My dad then texted, saying how he didn't expect Keith to lie to me like that. When I told Mom what happened later, she said that it was just Keith being Keith, but she'd talk to him about it later.

I'm wondering if I overreacted about him lying. On one hand, he was wrong for lying to me about what he did. On the other hand, I should've expected that he'd do smth like that and he's just being a stupid middle schooler.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-14T19:55:09.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, my (18f) parents both left the city on business trip, leaving me to take care of my younger brothers Richard and Keith (10 and 13 respectively).

"I (20sF) had a friend group (mostly late 20s and 30s, and mostly men) of people from another country. We didn't know each other in person, though some of them did.

I got along pretty well with them, and I was really close to Bob (20sM) and Eric (30sM). They were supportive, understanding towards me being from another culture, etc. 

At some point, Mark (30sM) joined the group, I tried getting along with him but I felt like he didn't like me, and as much as I tried to mask it I also sorta disliked his know-it-all attitude. 

That would be no issue, but something that started really bothering me was that Mark seemed to be heavily influencing Bob and Eric in their opinions. Some stuff we fully agreed on years ago would be seen as something they had to argue with me about as soon as Mark stepped in, some misunderstandings due to barriers wouldn't be given a chance of explanation, and if Mark didn't like a topic (which he never did when there was a misunderstanding from what I said) then everyone had to change the topic, even if he said he was gonna leave due to it. At the end, I had to just accept everyone would think I believed on something that has nothing to do with me due to a skewed interpretation of what I said.

The pedestal he seemed to be put on started to bother me and, after another misunderstanding, I got too emotive and got confrontational about how I felt I was being treated as well. I had pondered multiple times if I wanted to stay there and, that time, I decided to set a deadline to reflect on it. 

At the end of it, I decided to remove all of them from one of my social media accounts (which they already had done to me with their private accounts - since I always used mine as a private account, it felt fair to unadd them if it was making me uncomfortable). I also decided to leave the group. However, I didn't remove any of them in our main way of communication, after all what was making me uncomfortable was the group environment where they gotta appease to Mark.

(This post was getting too long, so this is a summarized version, but if anything got left out I can answer or add)","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-14T00:24:36.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (20sF) had a friend group (mostly late 20s and 30s, and mostly men) of people from another country. We didn&amp;#39;t know each other in person, though some of them did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got along pretty well with them, and I was really close to Bob (20sM) and Eric (30sM). They were supportive, understanding towards me being from another culture, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, Mark (30sM) joined the group, I tried getting along with him but I felt like he didn&amp;#39;t like me, and as much as I tried to mask it I also sorta disliked his know-it-all attitude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would be no issue, but something that started really bothering me was that Mark seemed to be heavily influencing Bob and Eric in their opinions. Some stuff we fully agreed on years ago would be seen as something they had to argue with me about as soon as Mark stepped in, some misunderstandings due to barriers wouldn&amp;#39;t be given a chance of explanation, and if Mark didn&amp;#39;t like a topic (which he never did when there was a misunderstanding from what I said) then everyone had to change the topic, even if he said he was gonna leave due to it. At the end, I had to just accept everyone would think I believed on something that has nothing to do with me due to a skewed interpretation of what I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pedestal he seemed to be put on started to bother me and, after another misunderstanding, I got too emotive and got confrontational about how I felt I was being treated as well. I had pondered multiple times if I wanted to stay there and, that time, I decided to set a deadline to reflect on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of it, I decided to remove all of them from one of my social media accounts (which they already had done to me with their private accounts - since I always used mine as a private account, it felt fair to unadd them if it was making me uncomfortable). I also decided to leave the group. However, I didn&amp;#39;t remove any of them in our main way of communication, after all what was making me uncomfortable was the group environment where they gotta appease to Mark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They got really mad at me for unadding them and leaving the group, and eventually blocked me from our main way of communication as well. &lt;/p&gt;

"Hey everyone, I'm a 26-year-old guy and I started dating a 28-year-old woman. We went on three dates and things seemed to be going well, at least that's what I thought. At the end of our third date, we shared a kiss. It felt a bit odd, but I shrugged it off since I'm pretty new to dating. After getting home, I texted her saying I had a great time. She replied similarly, and we continued chatting for a few days. I then asked if she'd like to be my girlfriend, but she expressed wanting to take things slow, which I totally respected. However, the next day, she told me she wasn't ready for a relationship and was unsure about her life direction. This stung a bit, but I understood. Yet, it made me wonder why she hadn't mentioned this earlier, maybe after our first or second date? Her responses became delayed and less warm after this. Nevertheless, two weeks later, I invited her to my uncle's Halloween party. She was initially enthusiastic and confirmed she had no other plans. A week later, I checked in, and she still seemed on board. Fast forward to the day before the party, she texts me that she can't make it because she had promised her son they'd watch the new FNAF movie - something she apparently planned three weeks ago, around the same time I invited her. It puzzled me why she hadn't mentioned this earlier when confirming her attendance. After this, she ghosted me for a week. When she finally reached out, she asked about the party, implying that I had disappeared, even though I was the last to text. I told her I didn't attend because I was looking forward to going with her. I asked about the movie, and she said she forgot about it and went out with her mom instead. She then emphasized that her son is her top priority, which I completely agree with. But after this conversation, I left her on read and we haven't spoken since.

"I (17F) met 'Steven' (18M) in April, he's my best friend “Ana”s classmate/friend. We all started hanging out 3-4 months ago. Soon after we met I told Steven I had a crush on Ana (who is happily dating) just to get it off my chest, he told me he had a crush on me &amp; I said it was fine, we tried kissing, I couldn't, it just felt wrong. After that I've told &amp; shown him that I'm not interested.

September: I met his friend 'Chris', at a party &amp; was kinda into him, my friend 'Lisa' was too, I didn't know him at all, so I let it be. Chris and Lisa went out once, but it was nothing serious (she's in love with another guy &amp; doesn't want to date). Chris did not show up to a few other parties where I was planning on finally talking to him. 2 weeks ago Ana, Steven, Chris, and I hung out. I was hoping to get him alone, but couldn’t. 

Last week I went out with Steven, both Lisa and Chris couldn't come, it was a bit awkward since we don't hang out alone. We were drinking, &amp; I was hoping that Chris would show. He told me ""I know who Chris likes"" I guessed Ana, &amp; he said yes. 

I was devastated, not because I cared much for Chris, but because I love Ana; Chris had taken my mind off of her, and for him to ALSO like her was just horrible, so I drunkenly text Lisa that Chris likes Ana. 

The next day Lisa texts Steven to confirm if it's true that Chris likes Ana. Steven says no, that I’m lying to keep Lisa &amp; Chris apart. He then starts texting me awful things &amp; says he'll have to tell Chris what I did. 

I call him in tears &amp; extremely confused, he then tells me that no; Chris likes Lisa. The thing is their real names rhyme, so he had heard Ana when I said Lisa (+ we were pretty tipsy). I don't think he believed me, &amp; went on about how you can trust me, how could I do this to Lisa, (I explained that Lisa isn't romantically interested in him, &amp; doesn't care who Chris is with). 

He texted me; ‘you're the most miserable person I've ever met', that I would never know real love, that he cared for me &amp; I used him, I don't value anyone &amp; only use people,  I *'dehumanized him completely'*, &amp; more.

He's creating a narrative where I did this with the intention of hurting him, he said; I am calculating &amp; have been using him this whole time, when I've only been into Chris for a few weeks. &amp; honestly, I didn't think he’d take it so personally or would cut me off completely if i kissed his friend, (who i figured out after the fact is actually his best friend). 

I might’ve hurt him, but he’s left me heartbroken with his nasty words &amp; perception of me; he sees me as evil *""I don't know how so much evil can exist in your mind”*, &amp; manipulating, for wanting to makeout with his friend. What I wanted to do wasn’t great, but it's not like I had feelings/would start dating his friend, I was just looking for some fun, probably too carelessly.

"I genuinely don't know if AITA would take this post because their rules are so fucking confusing. To set some backstory, my (20f) boyfriend (20m) and I have been together since we were 15. We're both autistic, which is important, because it makes our relationship seem a bit off to others. We like spending lots of time with each other, and we don't exactly understand what the expectations are for relationships in regards to people outside eof them. This is why I'm asking here.

My boyfriend comes over to my house (mostly) every day after work (about twice a week I go to his house). He comes over anywhere between 5:30-7:00pm, and leaves at 8:45pm. We hang out in a room by ourselves, and then go to my room, and then he leaves. He then sleeps over on weekends, typically Friday to Sunday, and leaves at 8:45pm.

My sister(25f) recently started dating a guy (25m). We both still live with our parents, so we live in the basement suite together and act as roommates of sorts. She used to bring her boyfriend over all the time. As in, at one point, he lived at our place for 3 weeks, never going home. I hated this. They had extremely loud sex, had lots of PDA in front of me and my boyfriend (we hate PDA personally), and just made us uncomfortable. But my bf in particular hates my sister's bf, because my sister's bf sexually harassed him while drunk. My sister knows this, my parents don't.

At one point my sister and her bf had a massive fight, and my stepdad banned him from our house. But last night, her bf's power went out and so he slept over at our place. And I hate it. Now she's saying he's going to sleep over again. When I tried to express my disapproval, she got extremely defensive and said ""well your bf comes over every day"" and my parents agreed, saying that it's comparable. I just don't think coming over for 2-3 hours, and then sleeping over on the weekend, is comparable to living with us for a month. I just don't want that cycle to start again.

Am I being unfair? I'm just so genuinely confused. I've even compromised by sleeping over at my bf's place, and going over there more. But I hate that I feel uncomfortable in my own house. I don't want someone who did something like that to my bf in my house.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-12T23:25:50.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I genuinely don&amp;#39;t know if AITA would take this post because their rules are so fucking confusing.

"So I (25F) and my girlfriend Ivy (25F, fake name for privacy) are both huge Taylor Swift fans. I personally love looking for queer themes or viewing her music from a queer lens. But I don’t think she’s queer. It would be cool if she was but I think she would’ve come out and said it by now if she was. Ivy on the other hand doesn’t stop there. She is insisting that Taylor is gay and that Travis Kelce is just a PR stunt to throw people off from her real sexuality. 

It all came to a head last night when we were keeping up with the eras tour in Argentina on Twitter/X and we see that Taylor sang “Karma is the guy on the chiefs” and ran to kiss him after the show. My reaction to this was to say “oh how cute” and move on with my evening. She seems happy and in love. 

Ivy however couldn’t help but say “it’s so obviously PR. I can’t believe you’re falling for this.” I work in PR so I’d like to think I have a decent bs meter when it comes to what’s a PR stunt and what isn’t so I took this as kind of an insult to my intelligence. 

I asked her why we couldn’t just take their relationship at face value and why it had to be PR. Cue a whole spiel about how the world wouldn’t accept Taylor as a lesbian. I thought this was silly as while I can accept that Taylor could have potentially been with women in the past, I don’t think she’s a lesbian. She’s clearly interested in men. 

But she continued to insist that Taylor’s gay and that only a real gay could see that. now that was personal because I’m bi and she’s a lesbian. I’ve been with men and my attraction to them was just as valid as my attraction to my gf. I told her that I am just as valid a member of the lgbtq community as she is. More valid than Taylor Swift is for damn sure. So I told her that she needed to stop insisting that Taylor’s gay because it’s made her into an invalidating and biphobic person. 

My gf said that I was being homophobic and still in my comphet era. I’m literally dating her. She said she didn’t want to talk anymore about it but said that “I needed to reassess how I treat lgbtq celebs” which is insane coming from someone who literally is creating conspiracy theories on a singer’s sexuality.

"Me F26 and my sister F31 had plans to go to hang out on a sunday 2 weeks ago, however the night before was my childhood friend ""Chelsea's"" bridal shower and she wanted me there. It was a surprise event  set up by the maid of honor that we all knew about months in advance. I went there about mid afternoon and was hanging out with the the girls and such (for those of y'all who know how bridal showers typically go) and it ended up being fairly late. Now, there was alcohol and i don't really drink but i had a couple margaritas over the course of the night so i stayed there until about 2am until i felt normal again and then headed home.

Now i woke up sunday morning about 10am to my sister ""Allison"" texting me wondering if i'm getting ready to go and letting me know i'll need a little bit of cash for this place she wants to check out. I explain that i had a long night at that bridal shower and got home at almost 3am and don't really want to go now, i'd rather sleep a bit longer and just hang out and play some games or catch up on my shows after i woke up, that i was sorry but just didn't really have the energy for going out and being around people all day again today. Allison gets mad and calls me a self centered bitch and how she's not even surprised bc i never want to go do anything fun with her, just sit and play my games or watch anime. I calmly explain again the situation last night, and then add in that i'm not sure why my personal life really matters so much to her at this point, that she knows by now i'm not huge on being out for long periods of time and that's how it usually goes when i'm with her.

She then screenshots the messages and sends them to mom saying i was being inconsiderate of the plans made and my mom comes to my room/house (i live with her in a converted garage) and says i should just go since i already agreed. and then i said ""did she happen to screenshot the parts where she calls me a self centered bitch and irresponsible for drinking with the girls when i had plans the next day"" and mom said no, but she's just acting that way bc i probably hurt her feelings by cancelling. I just said that may be so, but it doesn't mean she can talk to me like i'm doing something wrong, she's 31, she needs to learn how to communicate her feelings instead of being rude. I'd like to note that i was changing and getting ready to go anyway before mom came in and added to the issue. then i changed back into lazy clothes and put my headphones back on and texted Allison back and said ""well i was gonna go, but since you're 13 and not 31 and decided to tell mom on me, i guess i will actually skip today. have fun.""

So, AITBF for cancelling on her? Its been about 2 weeks as i said and she's still giving me a cold shoulder and attitude about it.

EDIT: She was over today for a little pre thanksgiving hangout thingy since we're all gonna be out of town that week or the day of, and we talked and she pretty much confirmed what y'all are saying that i should've just messaged her at some point that night when it started to run late. That she wasn't mad i cancelled or anything just that i waited till the next morning, two hours before to tell her I wasn't going. I apologized and said i didn't really think much of it at the time bc things would die down and then we'd start doing something else. she said she understood bc she's been to her fair share of showers and it be like that. Just next time message her beforehand and be like ""hey this is what is planned, but it may not be to the letter, so depending on how late i leave tomorrow may not be a good idea."" And she apologized for being childish and telling mom bc apparently her husband was taking my side on it saying it wasn't as big of a deal as she was making it, but that's neither here nor there i guess.

"Hey Reddit, I'm in a bit of a predicament with my girlfriend's dog, and I'm wondering if I might be the jerk here. Strap in, this is a bit of a read, but I need some advice.

So, my girlfriend has this dog, and I'm genuinely finding it hard to coexist with the furry troublemaker. The dog has this habit of jumping on people, leaving cuts and bruises due to anxiety about getting its nails clipped. Despite multiple attempts at training, nothing seems to work, and my girlfriend, in my opinion, is using a too-gentle approach that's not curbing the destructive behavior.

What bothers me most is that she lets the dog get away with it, using what I can only describe as a gentle parenting style instead of showing the dog that its behavior is wrong. We've discussed getting more professional training, but she's insistent on her sister-in-law handling it instead of bringing in a pro.

Now, here's where it gets tricky. I'm allergic to the dog hair, and I've tried to communicate my discomfort. She suggests medication, but that hasn't worked for me before, and taking it every day is not something I'm thrilled about. Plus, she isn't the cleanest person, so the combination of the allergies and the dog's behavior is a lot for me.

We're at a point where we're talking about moving in together and eventually getting married and having kids. However, this dog situation is making me seriously rethink whether I can have a life with someone who seems unwilling to address these issues. AITB for suggesting that maybe rehoming the dog is the solution, or is there a better way to approach this?

"‼️TW ‼️ Wrapped (iykyk)

Hello! I’m sorry if the title is confusing! I didn’t know how to title this since it’s a complicated situation.

 Okay so basically, I(18) have experienced a few horrible situations in my life. Sadly one of them was about me being wrapped. When I was 12, my brother’s friend ,who was 14, tried sleeping with me without my consent. I tried fending for myself but it didn’t help. Luckily, one of his friends walked outside and came to check on us. He promised me to keep it a secret since I didn’t want to ruin anyone’s friendship. It was a stupid decision since I couldn’t even go to their house anymore without having a mini panic attack. Anyways enough background, a couple days ago, I had a nightmare about the situation except it was him but with my boyfriend’s voice in it. I basically relived the entire situation again but worse since it was the person I trusted most instead. I woke up having a panic attack and I felt sick to my stomach. I told him about the dream through text and he felt horrible. I feel bad since it wasn’t his fault, but I genuinely think I can’t look at him or hear his voice without feeling sick or crying. I was planning on breaking up with him but I find it unreasonable too. ATM I’m just so confused on what to do and I see him in person tomorrow.

"I (Enby, 15) was paired with two guys (Both Male, 18) for a theater project. I was gone the day beforehand so I was put with them by default.

We'll call one Jack. Jack would not tell me what the project was supposed to be about. I asked him over and over, nicely, and he kept going off topic. I was confused so I asked an aid for help and she let me know it was supposed to be a puppet show with a musical element dealing with a societal issue. 

he wanted to do morality as the issue which i was kind of on board with, so we started talking about plot ideas. again, he overcomplicated it and went off topic and over all confused me, refusing to explain further. I was uncomfortable with these ideas, they made me really nervous even though I'm a really typically outgoing person. When I let him know my discomfort, he said things like ""Being uncomfortable is just a mindset"" or ""You need to step out of your comfort zone."" Which made me even more uncomfortable because I didn't want to be forced to do anything. 

I came up with a simpler plot and said I was open to other ideas (Basically, it was about a girl who posted a song on TikTok and got harassed for cringe levels.) I was hoping he'd make other suggestions to reel him back in to what the project is more supposed to be like but he didn't, and he kept calling my ideas silly. But for this one he was wanting to do japanese mythology about vampires to explain morality. It's creative but it's so off topic and seeing his other projects, he didn't make room for witty comments or funny plots or original ideas.

For this one, he also wanted to make the character I was playing do something I literally can't say on reddit or the mods will take my post down. He wouldn't explain what it had to do with the plot and it kind of appalled me.

In the end, I stopped listening to him and basically made us do my idea. I wanted him to add more ideas and I asked for them, but he didn't give any that I could understand or that was realistic. I feel bad.

"I (26f) have a friend (25m). This friend was in a really bad position with his family. He was abused all his life. Welp basically to summarize he lived in his families home of a recently passed family member. He was the only one to help care for them. 

They are gone now. He had no where to go and very little money. His uncle was put in charge of the estate and told to sell the home and items in it and split the cost between 7 people (my friend included) and to give himself %10 extra for the trouble of selling. 

No one wants the house. We are in a really small dying town and they want double what its worth. To make sure the home doesn't go to disrepair in the meantime they let my friend stay. Here's the catch. He is paying $500 a month in rent. All costs if something needs fixing (and his uncle has decided a lot needs fixing to improve the homes worth like plumbing or paint jobs and extensive lawn care) need to be paid for by my friend. If anything breaks its also on him. Also all utilities are also in my friends name and all home care is also %100 on my friend. My town is dying. Jobs here are limited hard to get and are often garbage. Your lucky if you make over $7ish a hour. I have a 2 bedroom for $650. I have a pet and all utilities except electric included. This is typical here and you can expect smaller places even low as $400 cause no one wants to live here its so bad. Also the uncle has cameras pointed inside windows so he can watch them something I think sounds creepy and illegal.

My friend is easily paying over $2000 a month in extra costs plus rent. A absurd amount here. Its %90 of his paycheck. His brother even has to help him and moved in to help. Now the uncle is demanding $1000 in rent starting January. The money goes towards the estate and he says its to prove someone lives there and its livable and to keep the home in good shape.

I spoke up and finally convinced my friend to leave. I gave him over $2000 to put a deposit on a cheap apartment and I had him sign a contract. Ive been calculating what I gave down to the cent and I have him on a recorded payment plan. Ive since had many people say Im being a ass expecting it back down to the cent. Am I?

Least he could do in my head is return all the money chump change or not.... I legally am right but am I morally?","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-12T12:50:13.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (26f) have a friend (25m). This friend was in a really bad position with his family. He was abused all his life. Welp basically to summarize he lived in his families home of a recently passed family member. He was the only one to help care for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are gone now. He had no where to go and very little money. His uncle was put in charge of the estate and told to sell the home and items in it and split the cost between 7 people (my friend included) and to give himself %10 extra for the trouble of selling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one wants the house. We are in a really small dying town and they want double what its worth. To make sure the home doesn&amp;#39;t go to disrepair in the meantime they let my friend stay. Here&amp;#39;s the catch. He is paying $500 a month in rent. All costs if something needs fixing (and his uncle has decided a lot needs fixing to improve the homes worth like plumbing or paint jobs and extensive lawn care) need to be paid for by my friend. If anything breaks its also on him. Also all utilities are also in my friends name and all home care is also %100 on my friend. My town is dying. Jobs here are limited hard to get and are often garbage. Your lucky if you make over $7ish a hour. I have a 2 bedroom for $650. I have a pet and all utilities except electric included. This is typical here and you can expect smaller places even low as $400 cause no one wants to live here its so bad. Also the uncle has cameras pointed inside windows so he can watch them something I think sounds creepy and illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend is easily paying over $2000 a month in extra costs plus rent. A absurd amount here. Its %90 of his paycheck. His brother even has to help him and moved in to help. Now the uncle is demanding $1000 in rent starting January. The money goes towards the estate and he says its to prove someone lives there and its livable and to keep the home in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke up and finally convinced my friend to leave. I gave him over $2000 to put a deposit on a cheap apartment and I had him sign a contract. Ive been calculating what I gave down to the cent and I have him on a recorded payment plan. Ive since had many people say Im being a ass expecting it back down to the cent. Am I? I did a massive favor for him and I gave him years of my savings to help him. Even he is saying the last parts are chump change and Im being a bit of a ass. Least he could do in my head is return all the money chump change or not.... I legally am right but am I morally?&lt;/p&gt;

I (16f)'s parents recently divorced and I now stay with my mum, who has moved in with her boyfriend and his daughter (15f), whom my mum told me was my half-sister ( we share a mother)

I have seen her on and off for maybe a meal since I was a little kid. I didn't particularly like her back then as she seemed hard to connect to and gives hugs wayyyy to excessively.

My half sister, who is only 9 months younger than me, idolises me really badly. She attempts to copy everything I do, which includes my daily habits, food choices, what games I play, what songs a listen, etc.

She is also extremely clingy to me, wanting to go literally everywhere I go.

She is really immature even though she is only a year younger than me. My mum has told me she has asd, but thats not an excuse to be annoying.

I don't even know why but I absolutely find this annoying and called her a bloody copycat and told her she is banned from doing the above things. She was upset but did it significantly less afterwards. I kinda feel bad so I wanna know if I am in the wrong here. After the advise I received I researched about autism and learnt about special interests and hers is a fictional character so I drew her a picture of it and she LOVED IT! But she is still banned from bothering or copying me. Now AITB?

"Hi all, I’m (18m) dating a girl (18f). We’ve been dating long distance for over a year. Things started out great, but she has issues. I helped her as much as I could and put her under my wing for over a year, even before we started dating. I really care for her.

Sadly, things haven’t been well, going back to december when we were both 17 and I called the authorities on her parents for mistreating her (with her permission, we had a talk about it beforehand) and it backfired, and she blamed me. I still cannot forgive myself.

Fast forward to today: she admits she is mentally unstable, is a walking contradiction (i.e. wanting me to stay and pushing me away at the same time, wanting someone to understand her yet not wanting people in her life, etc), and just “despises reality” and “doesn’t agree with it” thanks to these philosophy books she read, but the biggest factor is that she only left the household recently and is understandably affected by some sort of PTSD

I told her we should both get help as I ended up not doing well. I started seeing a therapist and I am in the process of seeing a psychiatrist. She, however, isn’t getting help because therapists didn’t work so I suggested a psychiatrist, but then I kept pushing her to until she agreed.

Am I the buttface for this?

To preface, this is my first post on Reddit so if I put this in the wrong place, use improper edict, etc. please tell me and I will try to correct it!

my(18m) friend group has been comprised of almost exclusively women since I was in 5th grade. My group has remained pretty consistent with the same five people since elementary school. This made me some what disillusioned me with romantic relationships with women and I think I might be aro/ace?(this story complicates things). For these reasons I have not been on a date or in a relationship before.

A few new people have joined our group since we have been in high school. One of which is Lily(18f), who joined the group last year. I started out getting to know her, because we would sometimes run into each other on our walk to school. On these walks I quickly realized that I was quickly falling in to feelings I had not felt before(I will spare you the paragraphs that would be needed to properly describe how incredible she is). I tried to push these emotions down and let it fade, and let our friendship flourish, but here I am a year and a half later with no change. We walk home together sometimes and we have become really good friends and I don’t want to compromise that. But if I could choose who I wanted my first relationship to be with it would be her without a doubt. There hasn’t been anything explicitly romantic about our conversation, but she does enjoy when we talk.

Now I don’t know if I waited too long and she will think that I was being her friend just to try to get with her. Any advice would be much appreciated!","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-12T17:42:02.000Z","post","Romantic","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To preface, this is my first post on Reddit so if I put this in the wrong place, use improper edict, etc. please tell me and I will try to correct it!&lt;/p&gt;

So I am a 25 year old male and a proud owner of a 12 yo Shih Tzu. His name is Togo, and he was the last gift from my mom before she passed. Togo has helped me through a lot of rough patches in my life. He was the first ever dog that I owned. I fed him, bathed him, walked him, everything. When I graduated from high school, I took him with me to college. He was pretty low maintenance, so I saw no problem with it. 

My friend (m24) met freshman year, and have been friends ever since. He rescued a chocolate lab about a year ago, and I had a few experiences with him before the incident. He seemed nice, but a little rough. My friend said that he was training him to be gentle. He usually took the dog wherever he went since because he didn’t have a backyard for him. 

 One day, he came over one day with his dog for the first time. Togo has been around dogs before, and he is very social and playful. I was nervous that my friends lab was still rough, so I kept Togo away from him. My friend kept trying to reassure me everything was ok and that he was “trained” eventually I caved and had us both leash our dogs before they meet. We let them greet each other, and after a painfully slow moment, they seemed friendly. My friend continued to bring the dog over more, and I began to feel more comfortable with Togo around him. 

Yesterday, me and my friend were hanging out after work. I had just put some kibble down for Togo. I went to the garage to grab a bear for me and my friend before I heard a howl. I rushed back to the kitchen to see my friends dog thrashing togo around in his mouth. I panicked, and I did want to lose togo, so I ran towards the lab and Locke dot as hard as I could. He released togo, but began to howl. I grabbed togo as he was bleeding, and it looked like his paw was broke. My friend was asking what happened, and I didn’t even respond as I got into my car and rushed to the vet. 

I got there, they took him in, and I was practically having a break down. I thought I was about to lose my best friend. My friend arrived later, but he was too late. I apparently broke the dogs rib and it punctured it’s lung. The lab bled out and as my friend described, “drowned in his own blood.” I felt terrible for killing them and I felt worse when my friend was cussing me out in the vets office. He hasn’t said a word to me since, and the vet hasn’t given me any update on Togo

"For context, I’m in theatre and I do crew, specifically backstage. (Basically, what I do is move set pieces around on stage to change the scene.) Today was the end of the 1st show of the year, and yesterday I was telling my family about the show and I was asking if they wanted to come see it.

My dad said “Sure, I’ll go cause you worked really hard on it. I just wish you were on stage.” I specifically told him SEVERAL times that I couldn’t care less if he didn’t go, but he kept pressuring himself to go to try to make me feel better, but ended up making me feel kind of guilty. Meanwhile, when I asked my mom, she asked if I was in the show. I was confused with this question since she knows I’ve been getting picked up and everything from rehearsal nearly everyday. I replied “Well yeah, why else would I be telling you about it?” She asked me what role I had, so I just said I was in backstage. She started laughing in my face, and kind of making fun of me for not being in cast. It made me a bit upset, but I brushed it off.

Today, after I got home from the show, my sister came into my room and started yelling at me. She asked why I wasn’t on stage for bows at the end, so I told her that crew was only supposed to stick out from the curtains and wave, while cast members went on stage and bowed. She told me our dad was getting ready to record but couldn’t see me, and so she got mad at me because she said she saw other crew people who weren’t listening walk out onstage to bow. I said sorry, and I thought that would be the end of it.

She started getting mad at me for doing theatre without being a cast member, and kept talking about how my dad has been picking me up nearly everyday, paying for $50 show fees (that go to Tech Week food, show shirts, costume pieces for actors, etc.) and he doesn’t even get to see me perform on stage. TBH, I could understand why he would be kind of upset about it since it’s just a lot of gas money, but I was starting to get pissed off.

I told her that I can’t memorize the last thing I ate, so I don’t know how I’ll memorize lines, or where to be/what to do on stage. She yelled at me and told me to ask our dad for acting classes and to “fix my memory.” She also mentioned that my dad said he might stop letting me into theatre if I don’t get into cast. Theatre is something I really like, something a lot of my friends do, and is like an escape from my home life to me, but I still feel kind of guilty for it.

Along with my question whether I am TBF or not, I don’t know what I should do. Should I do backstage next show while still feeling guilty? Should I try to be a cast member? Should I just quit theatre completely? What should I do?

TL;DR: I do theatre and I’m in backstage. I don’t want to be in cast because I don’t know how to act. My family is upset with me because my dad picks me up nearly everyday and spends 50 dollars on show fees for each show I do, just to not see me. Theatre is how I met a lot of my friends, and is how I get away from my home life, so I don’t know if I’m just spoiled or what I should do.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-11T23:25:01.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, I’m in theatre and I do crew, specifically backstage. (Basically, what I do is move set pieces around on stage to change the scene.) Today was the end of the 1st show of the year, and yesterday I was telling my family about the show and I was asking if they wanted to come see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad said “Sure, I’ll go cause you worked really hard on it. I just wish you were on stage.” I specifically told him SEVERAL times that I couldn’t care less if he didn’t go, but he kept pressuring himself to go to try to make me feel better, but ended up making me feel kind of guilty. Meanwhile, when I asked my mom, she asked if I was in the show. I was confused with this question since she knows I’ve been getting picked up and everything from rehearsal nearly everyday. I replied “Well yeah, why else would I be telling you about it?” She asked me what role I had, so I just said I was in backstage. She started laughing in my face, and kind of making fun of me for not being in cast. It made me a bit upset, but I brushed it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, after I got home from the show, my sister came into my room and started yelling at me. She asked why I wasn’t on stage for bows at the end, so I told her that crew was only supposed to stick out from the curtains and wave, while cast members went on stage and bowed. She told me our dad was getting ready to record but couldn’t see me, and so she got mad at me because she said she saw other crew people who weren’t listening walk out onstage to bow. I said sorry, and I thought that would be the end of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started getting mad at me for doing theatre without being a cast member, and kept talking about how my dad has been picking me up nearly everyday, paying for $50 show fees (that go to Tech Week food, show shirts, costume pieces for actors, etc.) and he doesn’t even get to see me perform on stage. TBH, I could understand why he would be kind of upset about it since it’s just a lot of gas money, but I was starting to get pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her that I can’t memorize the last thing I ate, so I don’t know how I’ll memorize lines, or where to be/what to do on stage. She yelled at me and told me to ask our dad for acting classes and to “fix my memory.” She also mentioned that my dad said he might stop letting me into theatre if I don’t get into cast. Theatre is something I really like, something a lot of my friends do, and is like an escape from my home life to me, but I still feel kind of guilty for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with my question whether I am TBF or not, I don’t know what I should do. Should I do backstage next show while still feeling guilty? Should I try to be a cast member? Should I just quit theatre completely? What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

"I know it sounds such a stupid question, but I (15M) am having a lot of troubles. I have been contemplating whether or not I really deserve having friends, let alone having someone I could call an SO. I still cannot let go of my past, my stupid younger self just made so many stupid decisions; which resulted in making people cry. A victim of my bullying.

I still can't accept myself and I still can't apologize properly. I don't think I could ever deserve friends, let alone wonderful people I've met that became my great friends. Yet I'm still reminded about my past self, being an absolute asshole to everyone. I don't want to see myself enjoying, and see the others which I've been an asshole to still suffer from my doings. It just feels so shitty to feel joy without suffering some repercussions.

And even more so if I feel love, it feels specially shittier to see myself enjoying like this. Like I've met a girl a year ago, and now we moved on to flirting like a couple... I don't deserve it. And I guess it perfectly fits so well that my religion prohibits having a romantic interest before 18. 

The me before pandemic was a total bastard, one where I just constantly fight everything and everyone. Didn't have friends and any sort of friendly relationship as far as I can remember. Now post pandemic, here I am enjoying myself with my friends and almost found myself a love life. But I have yet to properly apologize to the victims, and I don't know how to. Especially when they're all uncontactable. 

Now in December I'll be moving to another country, and there I have the option to study till end of highschool. It's a perfect opportunity for me to distance myself away, I think they can live properly without me anyways. I know I'm an asshole, I know I'm stupid, and I know I never once grew up as a better person.","r/AmItheButtface","2023-11-12T00:02:17.000Z","post","Serious","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know it sounds such a stupid question, but I (15M) am having a lot of troubles.

"I 26F went on a date with 24M tonight. We met on hinge and have been talking a little over a month. He hinted he wanted to meet up but never asked me out. I noticed he deleted hinge and was fed up with him not pulling any moves. I asked if he unmatched me or deleted hinge and he said he deleted hinge, I asked why and he said it was because he didn’t need it anymore. I asked him (flirtatiously) if it was because he had too many girls numbers. He said “quite the opposite, my dating game is weak.” I replied flirtatiously “probably because you never ask them out 😉.” he finally got the message, asked me out, and we planned it a week in advance. He told me the place and the time, we met and had pretty good conversation (only a couple of awkward moments) and a few drinks. We talked for a couple hours, eventually the check came. I assumed that he would take it but after a minute he still hadn’t reached for it. I asked if he wanted to split it, he looked at the check and said ya. I took my card out and placed it down but he never placed down his. 10 minutes later the waitress comes and takes the check and my card and he doesn’t say anything. Once the check comes, instead of mentioning anything about splitting it, he instead watches to see what tip I give and comments the importance of tipping well (I tipped 20 on a 100 dollar check). I’m not made of money, I’m a graduate student who is in school full time using my savings to pay for things while he has a full time job. While I did expect to have my half covered, I was willing and ready to at least split the check. I don’t think it was fair for me to cover everything and I have half a mind to Venmo request 60 bucks.

"Hey Reddit, I'm (23F) in a bit of a tough spot with a friend (20F) and could really use some perspective on whether I'm in the wrong here.  
  
So, Kate and I have been close since childhood, and we've considered each other bffs, or at least I thought so. Lately, it feels like she consistently chooses other people over me. Whether it's making plans or sharing important news, I often find out last or sometimes not at all. It's gotten to the point where I feel like a burden in her life.  
  
I get that Kate has other friends her age and doesn't always have time for me, but now i just feel like shit when I ask her to hang out and she says that she's busy or already has plans. I'm ok with that of course. Adding to that, I recently discovered she's been lying to me about certain things. When confronted, Kate brushed it off and said it wasn't a big deal, but it's seriously eroding my trust in our friendship. One of the times Kate said that she'll be going to the gym and later she'll be exhausted to meet me, I see in her IG story that evening that she went out with another friend, Kylie... I asked her about it casually and Kate said that ""it was just spontaneous"".  
  
I've tried talking to her about it, but she either denies everything or says that she's too busy. It's taking a toll on my emotional well-being, and I'm wondering if it's time to consider ending the friendship.

"So I (M26) have been dating my girlfriend (F24) for 5 years. I haven’t met her family and in likewise she hasn’t met mine. So as to finally meet each other, my girlfriend and I set up a dinner at our place with my mom and her dad.(My dad passed away when i was 5 and her mother divorced her father). My girlfriend was so excited and the look on her face when the doorbell rang was so adorable. We both went to open the door and when we did, we saw my mom and her dad holding hands. They were laughing it off and giggling, like people who have been dating for years. They walk inside and we all sit down at the table and start to eat dinner. As my moms laughing, i question why they were holding hands. She continues laughing and says “well it’s what you do when you’re with your boyfriend” and looked over at him. She explains that they met on tinder and were planning on getting married soon, and that they actually came to this dinner to tell us to break up. They both explained how once they got married it would be weird if my girlfriend and I kept dating, as we would become step sibling and recommend we break up now. I looked over at my girlfriend and she was looking over at them in shock, she looked like she was about to start crying. I calmly explained to my mom that me and her would be doing no such thing. She got mad and raised her voice at us and said we were being intolerable and that we were still young and had no reason for believing this relationship would get so far. At this my girlfriend started sobbing and i got up and hugged her as i yelled at my mom. I told both of them to leave and they have no right to demand me and girlfriend. Annoyed they picked up their stuff and left as i hugged and comforted my girlfriend. Now my mom and her dad have told our remaining family members and they have all sent us angry messages and cut contact with us. My girlfriend is devastated as she’s a huge family person and grew up close to all her family.

"I (M35) am torn with self-doubt and looking for outside perspectives on my recent decision to divorce my wife (F33), who is not only struggling with bipolar disorder but also with a severe and destructive spending habit. Our financial journeys were quite contrasting from the outset; I made a comfortable $150k, whereas she excelled with a $400k salary as a tech executive. Despite the high cost of living, I had saved $80k, only to have it vanish when she indulged in a spending frenzy on high-end hotels, a luxury car lease, and extravagant gifts for her friends, pushing us $40k into debt. Despite my devastation, I forgave her following her tearful pleas for forgiveness. My career took a turn for the better, and as I started earning over $1M per year, I managed to pay off our accumulated debts.

However, her financial habits took a more drastic turn for the worse after she lost her job. She went on a lavish three-month tour of Europe, spending $400k. The magnitude of her spending was staggering. Following this, I told her in no uncertain terms that our marriage couldn't survive another such episode and began to secure half my income in a separate account.

The situation at home grew even more strained with the arrival of our child. She started smoking and drinking heavily inside the house, blatantly ignoring the potential harm to our newborn. When I objected, she brushed off my concerns, and our relationship deteriorated to the point of sleeping in separate beds. The last straw came when she made baseless accusations of abuse against me, fled to her ex's house with our newborn and my car, and left a house littered with empty alcohol bottles.

During the divorce discovery, I was floored to learn she had been spending $70k a month since our child was born. Her unrestrained spending, compounded by her unemployment and negligent behavior towards our child, left me no choice but to seek a divorce.
