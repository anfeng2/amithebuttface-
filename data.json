Since Rex is a very high energy dog that needs allot of mental stimulation, this showed VERY quickly. Rex suddenly would ransack the garbage and scatter it everywhere, steal food off your fork before you could put it in your mouth, try to bite you if you came within a few feet of him if he was given a treat, attacked my cat by grabbing her in his mouth, thrashing and throwing her, and even jumped up and tried to eat my pet snake out of my hand.\n\nMe and Cole kept arguing about this, I told him it was because he completely abandoned everything to do with Rex, he said it had nothing to do with the training and didn't know why Rex was acting like this. Cole insisted that I wanted Rex put down every time I mentioned bad behavior, but I never even referenced putting him down, even after Rex attacked my cat.\n\nAs time went on and Rex got worse, Cole started yelling at Rex constantly, no positive reinforcement for good behavior. He would even hit Rex, grab his collar and yell in Rex's face. I told Cole he needed to stop doing this IMMEDIATELY because I noticed Rex was starting to show signs of fear and anxiety. Cole said this was the \"only way\" and continued.\n\nOne day, Rex spread garbage all over the house and Cole was fed up. Cole grabbed the back of Rex's neck, slammed him to the floor, sat on top of him and yelled in his face. Rex growled because he was obviously very scared, and Cole smacked him in the face and kept yelling.\n\nI started yelling at Cole to get off the dog, as soon as he did we started arguing. I told Cole this is abuse and would only make Rex fearful of him and that Rex wouldn't trust him anymore. Cole insisted this was simple discipline, and the only way to get the point across. Since Cole was sitting on the floor next to Rex, I grabbed the back of Coles neck, slammed him to the floor, and yelled \"this is how your dog feels\" in his face. Cole shoved me off.\n\nCole complained that entire week about how he felt like he couldn't trust me anymore after that, I insisted that it was \"simple discipline to get my point across\"\n\nMy mom, dad, sister and close friends agree with what I did to Cole since Cole never treated Rex like that again.

We had a good relationship but she had family issues. I had been helping her out long before we started dating. I stepped in with her permission and got authorities involved (December 2022, we were both 17). It backfired, her parents found out who I was and then they harassed her. She was telling me she was feeling faint and having trouble breathing. I was liable for anything bad that happened so I informed the authorities and the cops showed up at her place. Her trust in me died that day.\n\nWe did try to fix things, but it took a nosedive in June last year. I had been going through a lot and my mental state collapsed (hers was already pretty bad understandably). She got upset that I wasn\u2019t doing anything about it (my state is notorious for bad quality of care and bad accessibility to care). It had been going on for some time and I even grew insecure and paranoid because everyone said she was gonna try and cheat on me.\n\nIt got worse when college started for both of us. She was good in high school but was not doing well in college, while for me it was the opposite. She became a workaholic.\n\nIn October she admitted to me that she was 1. enabling my paranoia and depression for her own gain, 2. Toying with me for her own entertainment, 3. Lying, and then I asked why and then she toyed with me again saying \u201chow do you know I actually did these things?\u201d Kept going and going until a friend of ours confirmed what she had said.\n\nIn November we promised to fix things, even if we were separated for any reason. I saw her in December (it was long distance). A week after I left, she dumped me, claiming that I was just too unstable for her (gee, I wonder why). I told her I was gonna leave her be while I worked on myself and she said she\u2019d wait. Thankfully I was in a different state with better care and immediately started seeing a shrink (I genuinely want to fix myself for myself only, I\u2019ve been depressed for several years). \n\nMy plan is to work on myself, return to her, apologize, regain trust, and go from there. All of my friends are for it, the only people against it being a friend of mine (a former narcissist and said my ex is a sociopath), an ex of my ex (he said it was a terrible idea and told me how she absolutely fucked him up), and my mother (who is jealous because I was the only person who gave her attention until my gf showed up, and thinks I\u2019m stalking).

We had a good relationship but she had family issues. I had been helping her out long before we started dating. I stepped in with her permission and got authorities involved (December 2022, we were both 17). It backfired, her parents found out who I was and then they harassed her. She was telling me she was feeling faint and having trouble breathing. I was liable for anything bad that happened so I informed the authorities and the cops showed up at her place. Her trust in me died that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We did try to fix things, but it took a nosedive in June last year. I had been going through a lot and my mental state collapsed (hers was already pretty bad understandably). She got upset that I wasn\u2019t doing anything about it (my state is notorious for bad quality of care and bad accessibility to care). It had been going on for some time and I even grew insecure and paranoid because everyone said she was gonna try and cheat on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It got worse when college started for both of us. She was good in high school but was not doing well in college, while for me it was the opposite. She became a workaholic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In October she admitted to me that she was 1. enabling my paranoia and depression for her own gain, 2. Toying with me for her own entertainment, 3. Lying, and then I asked why and then she toyed with me again saying \u201chow do you know I actually did these things?\u201d Kept going and going until a friend of ours confirmed what she had said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In November we promised to fix things, even if we were separated for any reason. I saw her in December (it was long distance). A week after I left, she dumped me, claiming that I was just too unstable for her (gee, I wonder why). I told her I was gonna leave her be while I worked on myself and she said she\u2019d wait. Thankfully I was in a different state with better care and immediately started seeing a shrink (I genuinely want to fix myself for myself only, I\u2019ve been depressed for several years). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan is to work on myself, return to her, apologize, regain trust, and go from there. All of my friends are for it, the only people against it being a friend of mine (a former narcissist and said my ex is a sociopath), an ex of my ex (he said it was a terrible idea and told me how she absolutely fucked him up), and my mother (who is jealous because I was the only person who gave her attention until my gf showed up, and thinks I\u2019m stalking).

It was the first serious relationship I was ever in. I loved him, and gave up a lot of my time to be with him and help him through his struggles. However, there were plenty of red flags along the way that I ignored.\nHis apartment was never clean. You couldn\u2019t take a step into the doorway without tripping on a pile of laundry or a bag of empty cans. You couldn\u2019t even see the carpet in his room. He cleaned his room twice during our relationship; once when I helped him, and the other when he moved.\nHe had a plethora of personal hygiene issues. His hair was constantly greasy, he wore the same/dirty clothes for days in a row, and he didn\u2019t brush his teeth as often as he should have. (I pushed all of this aside because I understood mental health can take a toll on cleanliness.)\nHe got a night shift job halfway across town despite the fact that he couldn\u2019t drive. Me and a mutual friend, let\u2019s call her Sarah, ended up being the ones to drive him most of the time even though we worked mornings.\nAnd one of the biggest issues, he came out as polyamorous halfway through the relationship and admitted to having a crush on someone else. I didn\u2019t have a big issue with this because he respected my boundaries and didn\u2019t pursue anything, but it left me feeling empty nonetheless.\nThe real problem started when he began \u201cfake flirting\u201d with Sarah. He had introduced me and Sarah, and me and her became best friends very quickly. In turn we hung out a lot as a trio. He would make \u201cjokes and comments\u201d towards us about us being a throuple that I could tell made her visibly uncomfortable. One of the most uncomfortable I felt was when he \u201cjokingly\u201d claimed that he had a dream that we had a threesome.\nA month later we decided to go on a break, but remain friends. I was not very well mentally at this point, so when he told me he was back on dating websites a few days later, I pushed it aside. However, he then informed me a week and a half after our break that he had asked Sarah out, and been rejected. \nI wasn\u2019t overly shocked as I suspected he\u2019d had a crush on her for a while, but I was still hurt. I decided to be supportive because I didn\u2019t know how else to react.\nAfter talking to Sarah, I found out that he had messaged her multiple times on Snapchat about the possibility of mainly being intimate. I felt betrayed and angry, and responded to my emotions by sending voice notes over text, yelling at him.\nHe responded with confusion, and didn\u2019t seem to understand why I was angry.

It was the first serious relationship I was ever in. I loved him, and gave up a lot of my time to be with him and help him through his struggles. However, there were plenty of red flags along the way that I ignored.\nHis apartment was never clean. You couldn\u2019t take a step into the doorway without tripping on a pile of laundry or a bag of empty cans. You couldn\u2019t even see the carpet in his room. He cleaned his room twice during our relationship; once when I helped him, and the other when he moved.\nHe had a plethora of personal hygiene issues. His hair was constantly greasy, he wore the same/dirty clothes for days in a row, and he didn\u2019t brush his teeth as often as he should have. (I pushed all of this aside because I understood mental health can take a toll on cleanliness.)\nHe got a night shift job halfway across town despite the fact that he couldn\u2019t drive. Me and a mutual friend, let\u2019s call her Sarah, ended up being the ones to drive him most of the time even though we worked mornings.\nAnd one of the biggest issues, he came out as polyamorous halfway through the relationship and admitted to having a crush on someone else. I didn\u2019t have a big issue with this because he respected my boundaries and didn\u2019t pursue anything, but it left me feeling empty nonetheless.\nThe real problem started when he began \u201cfake flirting\u201d with Sarah. He had introduced me and Sarah, and me and her became best friends very quickly. In turn we hung out a lot as a trio. He would make \u201cjokes and comments\u201d towards us about us being a throuple that I could tell made her visibly uncomfortable. One of the most uncomfortable I felt was when he \u201cjokingly\u201d claimed that he had a dream that we had a threesome.\nA month later we decided to go on a break, but remain friends. I was not very well mentally at this point, so when he told me he was back on dating websites a few days later, I pushed it aside. However, he then informed me a week and a half after our break that he had asked Sarah out, and been rejected. \nI wasn\u2019t overly shocked as I suspected he\u2019d had a crush on her for a while, but I was still hurt. I decided to be supportive because I didn\u2019t know how else to react.\nAfter talking to Sarah, I found out that he had messaged her multiple times on Snapchat about the possibility of mainly being intimate. I felt betrayed and angry, and responded to my emotions by sending voice notes over text, yelling at him.\nHe responded with confusion, and didn\u2019t seem to understand why I was angry. I blocked him over Snapchat, and we didn\u2019t talk for days afterward. He sent me a message a few days later over Instagram, in which he claimed I was the one who had been manipulative and toxic throughout our relationship. \nI was appalled at first, but upon considering his words I began to experience a lot of guilt. I felt bad for yelling at him and letting my emotions get the best of me without explaining why I was angry in the first place.\nI apologized, but I still feel guilty for not handling the situation better.\nAITBF for yelling at my ex bf?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": true, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": true, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "33a88288-d02b-11e9-a0e7-0eed1401f080", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_22x5u9", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "id": "1bia983", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "mondayhatesU2", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 2, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1bia983/aitbf_for_yelling_at_my_ex_boyfriend_after_we/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1bia983/aitbf_for_yelling_at_my_ex_boyfriend_after_we/", "subreddit_subscribers": 103021, "created_utc": 1710817598.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "AmItheButtface", "selftext": "So I 17NB have a sister 19f who likes to party with friends.

I feel like I am busting my a*s, working a job and going to grad school to make more money and give our son a better life but he seems content working at Walmart and it&amp;#39;s starting to make me resent him. my family constantly asks me if he plans on just working there his entire life and I tell them no but I don&amp;#39;t know what he&amp;#39;s doing and it&amp;#39;s gotten to the point where they&amp;#39;re also constantly asking him what his plan is and causing conflict. we ended up getting into a huge argument over it and I told him that if in a year he is still working at Walmart I will leave him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "6740b348-cf01-11e9-b65e-0e5faddae3c4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_22x5u9", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "id": "1bgqjk2", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Prestigious_Till852", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 26, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1bgqjk2/aitbf_for_telling_my_bf_father_of_my_son_that_if/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1bgqjk2/aitbf_for_telling_my_bf_father_of_my_son_that_if/", "subreddit_subscribers": 103021, "created_utc": 1710654947.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "AmItheButtface", "selftext": "I went through a breakup about 6 months ago.

She continued to harass me and hide what she did for the majority of my senior year, leaving me with no friends or people to rely on. She used her influence as the senior representative of our grade to tell people to leave me alone and not talk to me. If they did not do that, she would harass them too.\n\nI kept quiet because we were originally in a secret queer relationship and her parents are really religious (they literally run the local temple). I also stayed docile because I feared speaking out due to the harassment my ex gave me to keep me quiet in the first place.\n\nMy friends knew about what happened to me, but brushed it off because they feared my ex's influence. One time I brought up how I might go to the school or police about it, and they told me not to because I \"would ruin my ex's life.\" (I did come forward to it with the school and police eventually, but never pressed charges in the end)\n\nThey cut me off shortly after that because they feared being harassed due to association with me.

She used her influence as the senior representative of our grade to tell people to leave me alone and not talk to me. If they did not do that, she would harass them too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept quiet because we were originally in a secret queer relationship and her parents are really religious (they literally run the local temple).

There used to be two designers but the other guy was fired last week because he made too many mistakes. I was surprised they finally fired him. He's been with the company for...I'm sure it was over 15 years. He was working there when the current owner bought the business. But I will admit, he did suck at the job. It was a long long long time coming. \n\nToday he emailed me at my work email address and asked that I send him a logo. I'm assuming he is trying to build a portfolio but he didn't say why he needed it. Only thing is, I didn't think he designed that logo. I could be wrong but I would be shocked if that was his work. I thought the customer had it created by a design firm. We usually don't do much creative design, we do more technical work needed to decorated/print items. \n\nI didn't want to get in trouble so I checked with the boss first.

are working at the same place, since it offers flexible hours and its next to our kids school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackstory: 6 years ago my husband got into an addiction to cocaine, I found out after one night after his work shift he sent me a message saying he needed this (substance) ,withdrew all our money, turned off his cellphone and went to a house with other coworkers to party and do a LOT of substance to the point he nearly died, after this I found out about other things, like that this coworker would share cocaine with him and they would do it during work hours.\n\nMy husband asked for an opportunity to change and get better, he quit his job, switch to another where he didn't have coworkers, I accepted to help him, for us and our family, It was AWFUL, the symptoms of dry hungover, his mood swings, it was a long exhausting journey.\n\nI always tell my husband I forgave what he put us through but I don't forget and I don't trust him (about substance) \n\nHe\u00b4s been clean for 5 1/2 years, we started this job two weeks ago and we realized this guy ( the one he would do cocaine with) is working there, when I saw him all of those bad moments came back to my mind, I felt upset and I communicated that to my husband he told me: \"just get over it, this was 6 years ago, it wont happen again\"\n\nYesterday I told him,  I'm embarrassed to see him at the least, I was the one looking for him that night (since my husband barely made it home) He knows who I am, I asked my husband please to not talked to him, ignore him and just pretend he doesn't know him, the amount

years ago my husband got into an addiction to cocaine, I found out after one night after his work shift he sent me a message saying he needed this (substance) ,withdrew all our money, turned off his cellphone and went to a house with other coworkers to party and do a LOT of substance to the point he nearly died, after this I found out about other things, like that this coworker would share cocaine with him and they would do it during work hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My husband asked for an opportunity to change and get better, he quit his job, switch to another where he didn&amp;#39;t have coworkers, I accepted to help him, for us and our family, It was AWFUL, the symptoms of dry hungover, his mood swings, it was a long exhausting journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always tell my husband I forgave what he put us through but I don&amp;#39;t forget and I don&amp;#39;t trust him (about substance) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He\u00b4s been clean for 5 1/2 years, we started this job two weeks ago and we realized this guy ( the one he would do cocaine with) is working there, when I saw him all of those bad moments came back to my mind, I felt upset and I communicated that to my husband he told me: &amp;quot;just get over it, this was 6 years ago, it wont happen again&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I told him,  I&amp;#39;m embarrassed to see him at the least, I was the one looking for him that night (since my husband barely made it home) He knows who I am, I asked my husband please to not talked to him, ignore him and just pretend he doesn&amp;#39;t know him, the amount of ptsd I get from seeing him is horrible, I told all of this to my husband he said he would not talk to him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;today , ran into them talking about work and

I asked my friends who he was and they kept telling me that he was an ick. Eventually at a party, Jason and I were taking photos together and he asked me if I could send them to him, I used this opportunity to get his phone number. \n\nWe ghosted each other for a little before Jason started randomly messaging me. We eventually started hanging out and a few strange things happened. There were a few times where he told me to shut up because I was being too loud(he once said this to me at a party where loud music was playing) or to act decently because I was swearing in public. We live in Australia and I\u2019m a wog so I\u2019m gonna be loud. When this happened, I would go quite bc of how embarrassing it was. \n\nEventually it got around to him that I liked him and at a mutual party, he confronted me. I tried to brush it aside by saying that I didn\u2019t like him anymore. After this confrontation, he kept talking to me and showed me these photos of him dressed in those really weird and racist Muslim \u2018costumes\u2019 from the 2 dollar store. This really pissed me off, I\u2019m one of those \u2018liberal snowflakes\u2019 people like to make fun of online but when he showed me this pic he expected me to laugh but I only called him out for it. \n\nIn our messages, he would send really weird flirtatious things. Like \u201cevery barbie needs her Ken\u201d and kept resending me a photo of him and I sitting together, teasing me about it. I slowly lost interest in him, seeing him better as a friend. \n\nI and Jason hung out at our local library to study. We eventually got out of the library and he asked me to join him to get food. He asked me to walk him back to his car after because he felt lonely. During this walk he asked me about the yes or no vote. This was basically a referendum vote in Australia to allow our First Nations people an advisory body in government. I\u2019m a leftist, so I retorted with voting yes. I was 17 at the time and couldn\u2019t vote whereas he was 18. so I asked him the same question but all he said was \u201cinteresting\u201d and ignored it. This threw me off guard, I\u2019m personally a really political person and I\u2019d prefer if my friends shared the same values as me. He knew this and when he didn\u2019t answer I knew he was going to vote no. \n\nThat night we were messaging each other and I called him a misogynist as a joke. He thought I was being serious and sent a full paragraph to explain why and how he wasn\u2019t. This turned me off completely and the next day I blocked him without explaining anything. Everything weird about him kinda built up and honestly from the start I should\u2019ve distanced myself away from him. I\u2019ve felt guilty about it ever since. So, AITB?

We live in Australia and I\u2019m a wog so I\u2019m gonna be loud. When this happened, I would go quite bc of how embarrassing it was. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually it got around to him that I liked him and at a mutual party, he confronted me. I tried to brush it aside by saying that I didn\u2019t like him anymore. After this confrontation, he kept talking to me and showed me these photos of him dressed in those really weird and racist Muslim \u2018costumes\u2019 from the 2 dollar store. This really pissed me off, I\u2019m one of those \u2018liberal snowflakes\u2019 people like to make fun of online but when he showed me this pic he expected me to laugh but I only called him out for it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our messages, he would send really weird flirtatious things. Like \u201cevery barbie needs her Ken\u201d and kept resending me a photo of him and I sitting together, teasing me about it. I slowly lost interest in him, seeing him better as a friend. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I and Jason hung out at our local library to study. We eventually got out of the library and he asked me to join him to get food. He asked me to walk him back to his car after because he felt lonely. During this walk he asked me about the yes or no vote. This was basically a referendum vote in Australia to allow our First Nations people an advisory body in government. I\u2019m a leftist, so I retorted with voting yes. I was 17 at the time and couldn\u2019t vote whereas he was 18. so I asked him the same question but all he said was \u201cinteresting\u201d and ignored it. This threw me off guard, I\u2019m personally a really political person and I\u2019d prefer if my friends shared the same values as me. He knew this and when he didn\u2019t answer I knew he was going to vote no. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night we were messaging each other and I called him a misogynist as a joke. He thought I was being serious and sent a full paragraph to explain why and how he wasn\u2019t. This turned me off completely and the next day I blocked him without explaining anything. Everything weird about him kinda built up and honestly from the start I should\u2019ve distanced myself away from him. I\u2019ve felt guilty about it ever since.

class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AITB; Am I the buttface for asking for a refund?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! Haven\u2019t posted much so I apologize if this isn\u2019t a great format. Figured I\u2019d just post the screenshots and let you all decide who TA is. Mine are the blue messages, I think I blurred out anything that would identify either myself or the seller (gray messages). This was a long time ago as you can tell from the dates (make sure you look at the dates, they\u2019re relevant to the story), but I was just going through old Messenger messages, found this again, and thought I\u2019d ask for a ruling. I was trying to be courteous and understanding, but I do recognize that there does need to be an expected delivery of a paid service as well. I take blame for not giving or having reasonable expectations in that regard. She blocked me on messenger after this interaction.

I met a guy there who I will call Jerry (41M) who I have been on again off again sleeping with as I explore all of that. He is an experienced dom, and *he told me he was divorced and single*. He had a fairly neutral reputation as he was newer to this city, having moved here recently as well. From my understanding he had moved here after wanting to get away after his divorce and be closer to his kids\u2014he has two grown children a few years younger than me. The age would\u2019ve been a dealbreaker for me if I was looking for a relationship, but we got on well and he was an experienced dom, and I just wanted to explore sexually so it seemed like a good match.\n\nI also do theater in my area. There is a large range of ages involved and I ended up making friends with a gal who I will call Sarah (24F) when we were in a show together. Spoiler alert, she turned out to be Jerry\u2019s daughter. I didn\u2019t even think that that might be a possibility. Sarah is married and took her husband\u2019s last name, so I didn\u2019t even have a last name to connect the dots with.\n\nWell on Father\u2019s Day, Sarah made a post about her dad and her ***stepmom***. I saw the picture and there Jerry was, with his wife (late 30sF - I\u2019ll call her Jane)??? Apparently he divorced Sarah\u2019s mom a few years back after *she* cheated, dated Jane online and moved to this city to be with her. I didn\u2019t know about *any* of this.\n\nI immediately chewed Jerry out and broke off all contact, but I didn\u2019t tell Sarah. I\u2019m very private and I knew if I admitted it I\u2019d have to talk about being into BDSM and how I met Jerry, and the fact that I was sleeping with a 41 year old and how stupid I was to not realize. I sent an anonymous message to Jane but she never responded and I didn\u2019t see anything big happen on social media or anything so I guess she just ignored me?\n\nWell, a couple weeks ago Sarah called me to chew me out. Apparently Jane was going through Jerry\u2019s phone because she suspected something was up, and found all his pictures of me (which I had told him to delete). She went absolutely nuclear, which I don\u2019t blame her for, but she also showed the pictures she found to Sarah and Sarah recognized me. I tried explaining that I messaged Jane, and that I broke things off with Jerry the moment I knew, and that I was just embarrassed and hadn\u2019t wanted to share that intimate part of my life with her, but she didn\u2019t want to hear it. She says that when Jane didn\u2019t respond I should\u2019ve told her, and that I\u2019m irredeemable for allowing Jerry to get away without consequences. I can see her side, but I honestly don\u2019t know what to think.\n\nTl;dr: My casual sexual partner ended up to be my friend\u2019s dad and was cheating on his wife.

Yesterday, I posted this thread in AITA before it was removed because it mentioned violence. When I posted this thread yesterday, I was just feeling sad. But now, I'm angry. I can't help but feel angry at everyone and everything, including my little sister. I've copied-and-pasted my post in AITA here:\n\n\"I (m30) have an 18-year-old sister named Angela. For the first 10-ish years of her life, Angela was a normal happy girl, and our family was normal. After her 10th birthday, our father turned into a monster towards her. Our mother did not actively hurt my sister, but mom did nothin to keep her safe. I was in the Navy while my little sister was going through hell at home, and I was oblivious to everything. I mean, sometimes I would visit my family, and my sister was no longer the cheerful little girl that I knew, but I just thought it was typical teenage angst.\n\nMy sister told me, only relatively recently, why exactly she was so moody and downcast throughout the past several years. I was stunned, and I helped her run away and she lived with our aunt and uncle (who are awesome and they have reigned hell on our parents) until she moved away for college.\n\nMy sister and lost her temper at me last month. She regularly has mood swings, and she would alternate between being kind and compassionate towards me, and being so angry. Anyway, last month, she told me that she hates me and that she blames me for not rescuing her earlier. She said the most awful stuff during our argument. And I didn\u2019t argue back at her. What could I say to someone who has been through what she\u2019s been through? She did apologize to me in the evening, and all I could do was apologize to her.\n\nA few days afterwards, Angela visited my wife and I. I sat down with my sister, and I really urged her to go to therapy (I don\u2019t know if her college\u2019s health and wellness center would suffice but she does have access to that) and figure out how to let go of her anger. I motioned with my hand, and I turned my hand into a tight fist and just released it, telling her to let go like that. I regret saying this, because my sister started crying, and she just screamed that she wants to die.

Yesterday, I posted this thread in AITA before it was removed because it mentioned violence. When I posted this thread yesterday, I was just feeling sad. But now, I&amp;#39;m angry. I can&amp;#39;t help but feel angry at everyone and everything, including my little sister. I&amp;#39;ve copied-and-pasted my post in AITA here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I (m30) have an 18-year-old sister named Angela. For the first 10-ish years of her life, Angela was a normal happy girl, and our family was normal. After her 10th birthday, our father turned into a monster towards her. Our mother did not actively hurt my sister, but mom did nothin to keep her safe. I was in the Navy while my little sister was going through hell at home, and I was oblivious to everything. I mean, sometimes I would visit my family, and my sister was no longer the cheerful little girl that I knew, but I just thought it was typical teenage angst.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister told me, only relatively recently, why exactly she was so moody and downcast throughout the past several years. I was stunned, and I helped her run away and she lived with our aunt and uncle (who are awesome and they have reigned hell on our parents) until she moved away for college.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sister and lost her temper at me last month. She regularly has mood swings, and she would alternate between being kind and compassionate towards me, and being so angry. Anyway, last month, she told me that she hates me and that she blames me for not rescuing her earlier. She said the most awful stuff during our argument. And I didn\u2019t argue back at her. What could I say to someone who has been through what she\u2019s been through? She did apologize to me in the evening, and all I could do was apologize to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days afterwards, Angela visited my wife and I. I sat down with my sister, and I really urged her to go to therapy (I don\u2019t know if her college\u2019s health and wellness center would suffice but she does have access to that) and figure out how to let go of her anger. I motioned with my hand, and I turned my hand into a tight fist and just released it, telling her to let go like that. I regret saying this, because my sister started crying, and she just screamed that she wants to die. I initially tried talking soothingly with her, but she was so loud and panicky that I got angry with her (I couldn&amp;#39;t help but get angry at her), and I told her \u201cyou can\u2019t fucking live like this\u201d. She makes me want to cry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of us can really help our emotions. With that being said, AITB for being viscerally angry at my little sister?

The members are a long term friend group of mine with a few additions here and there.\r\n\r\nI invited my ex months back, before we were dating, she became friends with people on there and we ended up dating but have now split.\r\n\r\nYesterday I wanted to remove her, I talked to a friend and they strongly disagreed with it. Saying if my girlfriend had dumped me instead I'd still be expected to keep her in the server, and told me \"we both know she was using you as a therapist\" which was part of the reason I broke up with her, along with other things.\r\n\r\nThey suggested I talk to ex, I did and she agreed to leave. I told her I'd let her stay till she set up a new server and friended people, as I didn't want to cut her off I just don't want to be around her.\r\n\r\nAfter this she told our friends who told her to stay anyway, and she back tracked.\r\n\r\nIt went public and I was told to put her in \"quarantine\" (restricting her to only a couple chats) so I could pretend she doesn't exist. I insisted I just want her to leave so I could have space to heal.\r\n\r\nI was called stubborn, told I was breaking the community, told I was \"kicking her out of our home\", and when I brought up how I just didn't want my ex in my passion project I was told \"it's not your passion project anymore it's a community\"\r\n\r\nContext: The server is a Murder Mystery at heart. I run the server, I built the server from scratch for us to play, I wrote up the Scenarios that I run, make Roles for people to pick from, and made countless role-playing chats. I run this entirely alone the majority of the time, hence why I class it as my passion project.

Due to several reasons I don&amp;#39;t wish to discuss as it&amp;#39;s a painful subject at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I run a Role Playing Discord Server, for well over a year at this point. The members are a long term friend group of mine with a few additions here and there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I invited my ex months back, before we were dating, she became friends with people on there and we ended up dating but have now split.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I wanted to remove her, I talked to a friend and they strongly disagreed with it. Saying if my girlfriend had dumped me instead I&amp;#39;d still be expected to keep her in the server, and told me &amp;quot;we both know she was using you as a therapist&amp;quot; which was part of the reason I broke up with her, along with other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They suggested I talk to ex, I did and she agreed to leave. I told her I&amp;#39;d let her stay till she set up a new server and friended people, as I didn&amp;#39;t want to cut her off I just don&amp;#39;t want to be around her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this she told our friends who told her to stay anyway, and she back tracked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It went public and I was told to put her in &amp;quot;quarantine&amp;quot; (restricting her to only a couple chats) so I could pretend she doesn&amp;#39;t exist. I insisted I just want her to leave so I could have space to heal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was called stubborn, told I was breaking the community, told I was &amp;quot;kicking her out of our home&amp;quot;, and when I brought up how I just didn&amp;#39;t want my ex in my passion project I was told &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not your passion project anymore it&amp;#39;s a community&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Context: The server is a Murder Mystery at heart. I run the server, I built the server from scratch for us to play, I wrote up the Scenarios that I run, make Roles for people to pick from, and made countless role-playing chats. I run this entirely alone the majority of the time, hence why I class it as my passion project.

My friend (18F), who we will call Nikki, and I (18M) created a group of each of our close friends, which ended up being around 10 people of 4 guys and 6 girls. With this group, we spent basically every day together during our junior year summer\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, during the school year, I started to feel distant from the group. I originally chalked it up to clubs/school work, and would sometimes be gone for tournaments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 2 months of this, I started to realize that even when I was able to hang out with them, it felt very odd. They would whisper to each other when I was around, they would give a judging remark to anything that I said, and would overall kind of ignore me and these other two girls that were closer to me, who will go by Rachel and Stella (Both 18f).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 months later and a year from today, it all came to a head right before our school's winter ball, which I thought we would go to as a group. However, a week before the dance, Nikki texts our group chat accusing of me, Rachel, and Stella of planning a sleepover for the night of the dance without them. I shot this down, because none of us had even discussed anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis brought hours of argument, which ended when they 180'ed the conversation. They began to say that it wasn't about the sleepover, and were just distancing for differing reasons. Most of their complaints were that they didn't really feel like they understood my humor and how it was different, but one stood out. One of the guys, Max (18m), expressed that he was uncomfortable with the bro-mantic/gay jokes, which was a problem because I was bi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith everyone telling me all of that, they stopped talking in the group chat. We stopped talking in person. This hurt me. I even cried for the first time in a while. I wasn't sad about them cutting me off, but about how they didn't try to repair the friendship. It took me months and going to college to make new friends, and even more for my trust issues to come back. To this day, I still overthink once in a while and it has made me more closed off than I was before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to now, I have a new group and in college, with the old group going to the same college. Nikki and another girl in the old group, will be named Sara (18f), have come up to me many times and tried to make conversation, which always end up being small talk. I absolutely hated this, and wished to be basically left alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, when Sara texts me asking to catch up. Pent up due to them essentially pretending as if we were still friends, I sent her a angry paragraph to her explaining that I did not want to talk and how I was hurt by what had happened in the past.

My friend (18F), who we will call Nikki, and I (18M) created a group of each of our close friends, which ended up being around 10 people of 4 guys and 6 girls. With this group, we spent basically every day together during our junior year summer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, during the school year, I started to feel distant from the group. I originally chalked it up to clubs/school work, and would sometimes be gone for tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After 2 months of this, I started to realize that even when I was able to hang out with them, it felt very odd. They would whisper to each other when I was around, they would give a judging remark to anything that I said, and would overall kind of ignore me and these other two girls that were closer to me, who will go by Rachel and Stella (Both 18f).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 months later and a year from today, it all came to a head right before our school&amp;#39;s winter ball, which I thought we would go to as a group. However, a week before the dance, Nikki texts our group chat accusing of me, Rachel, and Stella of planning a sleepover for the night of the dance without them. I shot this down, because none of us had even discussed anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This brought hours of argument, which ended when they 180&amp;#39;ed the conversation. They began to say that it wasn&amp;#39;t about the sleepover, and were just distancing for differing reasons. Most of their complaints were that they didn&amp;#39;t really feel like they understood my humor and how it was different, but one stood out. One of the guys, Max (18m), expressed that he was uncomfortable with the bro-mantic/gay jokes, which was a problem because I was bi.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With everyone telling me all of that, they stopped talking in the group chat. We stopped talking in person. This hurt me. I even cried for the first time in a while. I wasn&amp;#39;t sad about them cutting me off, but about how they didn&amp;#39;t try to repair the friendship. It took me months and going to college to make new friends, and even more for my trust issues to come back. To this day, I still overthink once in a while and it has made me more closed off than I was before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back to now, I have a new group and in college, with the old group going to the same college. Nikki and another girl in the old group, will be named Sara (18f), have come up to me many times and tried to make conversation, which always end up being small talk. I absolutely hated this, and wished to be basically left alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day, when Sara texts me asking to catch up. Pent up due to them essentially pretending as if we were still friends, I sent her a angry paragraph to her explaining that I did not want to talk and how I was hurt by what had happened in the past. She passively aggressively texts back that she had never took a part in kicking me out, and that she just wanted to check up on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now none of them talk to me, which I think it is good. However, I think I may have been too mean and she could also be right in the way that she was never involved.

I love to decorate and despite my age I still have an attachment to all things sparkly and cute, but usually I keep it contained to areas that are private like my house, especially the fandom stuff.

I recently found some stickers online I really like and started decorating everything including my water bottles, my reader and even my laptop. I love to decorate and despite my age I still have an attachment to all things sparkly and cute, but usually I keep it contained to areas that are private like my house, especially the fandom stuff. I blame ADHD impulses for the sudden need to re decorate my space, but I just had a need to express myself creatively and I was stuck in a writing slump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mother said that it was rather childish and unprofessional and that people might judge me especially in a professional surrounding. I am torn on the one hand I can see where she is coming from, not just the stickers, but also the impulse baying.

still giving me the cold shoulder over it. A week ago, my parents left for a business trip and left me and my brothers home alone. Everyday, our parents would check up on us before we'd go about our day. For most of that week, Carson was sick, so I'd keep track of what medicine he took and what time he took it as well as call his school to report his absence. I'd also go to university a little later to make sure my other brother Felix (9m) went to school.\n\nOn Thursday, Carson felt slightly better, so we decided that he'd go to school on Friday. I returned from university a little later (at 6:00PM), and almost immediately, my parents called me to go to the pharmacy near our place to buy some cough syrup in case Carson needed it, so I did. I felt very tired and sleepy afterwards since it was a long day, so I decided to take a nap.\n\nI expected to sleep for only 1-2hrs, but I guess I was very sleepy because I woke up at 1 in the morning. I stepped into the hallway to get myself a drink of water, but then I heard some noises downstairs. I walked to the living room to find Carson watching tv. I probably wouldn't have cared if it weren't for the fact that it was a school night, so I confiscated the remote and told Carson to go to bed. He smiled and walked to his room in the basement.\n\nThen I went to check on Felix, only to find him watching videos on his phone, so I did the same to him. Then I remembered that it would be a garbage day the next morning, so I went outside to take the trash out, when I noticed the basement lights were on. I walked downstairs to find Carson on his phone. Exasperated, I took his phone and the other remotes in the basement (since the room had TVs as well) and told him that if I caught him doing that again, I'd call Mom. He obliged, then I walked upstairs, only to hear Felix running around giggling. Having had enough of their actions, I yelled that I'm telling Mom and did just that.\n\nShe was very mad, and asked me to go to their rooms with video camera on so she could scold them. Carson was silently crying, while Felix pretended to sleep, then she told me to clean the kitchen, and then study for a bit before going back to sleep, which I did.\n\nIn the morning, Carson was very pissed off with me for calling Mom on him. He didn't want to do anything I told him to because of what I did, including taking his daily medicine. He also refused to help me out with the house chores out of spite, despite the fact that it would be the day that our parents would return.\n\nIn the end, even though he mostly got over it, he still is being upset with me, so I have to wonder if I went a little too far with this.

I want to talk to him but he left me on read. I offered to make things right but he won't answer me.

He said that things in his life are not going well and realizing that someone he thought was his close friend kicked him to the curb made it worse.

He has every right to be angry&amp;quot; My brother says there&amp;#39;s more that there&amp;#39;s more my friend told and asked him about me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question at hand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was his birthday but I was away doing my proposal. I sent him a birthday wish and my engagement photos to the group. According to my brother, that&amp;#39;s all the group could talk about while my friend just sat silently. He sent a congratulatory message but my brother said he looked annoyed, saw the photos and basically just sat silently for the rest of the night. According to my brother, only he and my friend&amp;#39;s best friend know how he&amp;#39;s been feeling about me and they said it was tacky for me to do this and pretty much make his birthday a pseudo engagement party for me. I want to talk to him but he left me on read. I offered to make things right but he won&amp;#39;t answer me. My brother told me to give him time but I know I haven&amp;#39;t been there and I didn&amp;#39;t know things were so bad with him. His best friend and my brother told me that I could have waited a day but I was too excited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Sent my engagement photos as part of my well wishes for his birthday. His friend and my brother told me that I basically hijacked his birthday and I am in the wrong for not waiting a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I the buttface here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fine, you people were right, I was the BF here. My friend&amp;#39;s message wasn&amp;#39;t angry, it was just sadness. I wish he would scream at me or lash out but it just reiterated how sad it was to feel like he was tossed away after being there for me during my darkest hour. He said that he couldn&amp;#39;t handle the resentment from the abandonment anymore and that I was the main reason he got rid of IG because it showed how happy I was without him and without our group. He said that things in his life are not going well and realizing that someone he thought was his close friend kicked him to the curb made it worse. He thanked me for the good memories and said that we will only be communicating at social events with the rest of the group and told me and my brother to not get anybody else in my original group of friends involved because he doesn&amp;#39;t want them to feel awkward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "6740b348-cf01-11e9-b65e-0e5faddae3c4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_22x5u9", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "id": "1b5od2u", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "[deleted]", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 177, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "permalink": "/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1b5od2u/aitb_for_sending_my_friend_my_engagement_photos/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1b5od2u/aitb_for_sending_my_friend_my_engagement_photos/", "subreddit_subscribers": 103021, "created_utc": 1709491194.0, "num_crossposts": 1, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "AmItheButtface", "selftext": "My sister (33/f) is an alcoholic and doesn't think she has a problem.

I feel like it's a serious lack of respect. I know I can't tell her what to do as far as \"don't talk to him anymore/in front of me\", and that she's gonna do what she's gonna do, but am I being an asshole if I tell her she can't be in the same room if that's what she'd rather do?\n\nTo reiterate, I'm trying to keep things on as good of terms as possible because of our child.

It was hard to adjust to it at first, but now I've grown accustomed to it. I have this friend we'll call Lucy (19f). Lucy is super nice and cool, however I've lately grown annoyed by her. You see, all she ever talks to me about is her ex-boyfriends. While I'm always open to letting her vent, it's gotten too much and I just wish that we'd talk about anything other than boy drama. She'd even ask me to spy on them for her, which I didn't want to do. Recently, one of her exes also texted me suddenly.\n\nHowever, I also didn't want to cut her off. She was really nice and caring, and she already lost so many friends that it just feels too cruel to do so. So I decided to text my best friend Mira (19f) about this to ask for advice. She told me that I should tell Lucy about how I feel about this. That I'd like to talk about stuff other than her exes since it was too much for me but I'd also like to be her friend at the end of the day. Mira also told me that it would be a good idea to let Lucy know that one of her exes contacted me. So I did just that.\n\nLucy apologized for talking too much about this and for her exes bothering me. This she said \"anyways thanks for listening\" which was weird. I was scared that she was taking it the wrong way when I asked her to talk about her exes less so I sent her other messages telling her that I'd like to still be friends with her and that she's really cool I just wanted a few boundaries. She read them but didn't respond. Mira suggested to leave Lucy alone for a few days since she might still be processing it.\n\nThe day after, I decided to try to speak to Lucy again, but she acted cold towards me and brushed me off. I felt horrible, but I thought that if she only ever wanted to talk to me to vent about her love life, then maybe we shouldn't be friends at all so I stopped talking to her. Then yesterday, she texted me suddenly, so I replied. She then asked to me to spy on one of her exes, as if the whole conversation never happened. So I stopped responding to her.\n\nToday, I told some of my other friends about what happened over the last week. The majority of them think that I was in the wrong and that I should've just let Lucy vent. They are all against me, except for Lucy's ex-best friend and Mira, who think that I did the right thing.

I talk to various producers that are still fairly underground, there\u2019s one that I talk to occasionally through text message and I have bought beats from him before. \n\nI showed my very close friend one of his beats as we were riding in the car one night talking about music and our goals with it. Fast forward to today we are messing around recording (on my studio equipment, he doesn\u2019t have any of his own) and he has headphones on so I can only somewhat make out what he\u2019s hearing. He pulls up a beat (the beat I had played for him once) and starts recording on it, He asked me to mix it because I have a lot more experience with it and I did, but then I started thinking about how I had showed him this beat and had plans of using it for myself for my own music.\n\n AITA for not letting him use it for himself? I am willing to maybe put him on the song as a feature and release it for myself but I dont think I can sleep happily knowing my friend is benefiting off of my ideas that he knows have been in the works for years. We do have other songs together but he has released all of them and I still haven\u2019t gotten any. This one is special to me and my personal artistic style that I have been developing, and he would not know this beat even existed if it wasn\u2019t for me showing him so thats why I\u2019m very torn about it.\n\nShould probably be mentioned that this is a friend I do share similar goals with and would of course like to maintain a working relationship with when it comes to music. And the song he recorded is still very incomplete. I just don\u2019t know how to word it if I do decide to not let him release it. Any input is appreciated.\n\nEdit: I do not exclusively own the beat (yet at least), but I am the only one with contact to the producer, my friend was previously completely unaware of the producer and is still unaware of who exactly he is or where to find any similar beats because it is a very particular sound.

He pulls up a beat (the beat I had played for him once) and starts recording on it, He asked me to mix it because I have a lot more experience with it and I did, but then I started thinking about how I had showed him this beat and had plans of using it for myself for my own music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA for not letting him use it for himself? I am willing to maybe put him on the song as a feature and release it for myself but I dont think I can sleep happily knowing my friend is benefiting off of my ideas that he knows have been in the works for years. We do have other songs together but he has released all of them and I still haven\u2019t gotten any. This one is special to me and my personal artistic style that I have been developing, and he would not know this beat even existed if it wasn\u2019t for me showing him so thats why I\u2019m very torn about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should probably be mentioned that this is a friend I do share similar goals with and would of course like to maintain a working relationship with when it comes to music. And the song he recorded is still very incomplete. I just don\u2019t know how to word it if I do decide to not let him release it. Any input is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I do not exclusively own the beat (yet at least), but I am the only one with contact to the producer, my friend was previously completely unaware of the producer and is still unaware of who exactly he is or where to find any similar beats because it is a very particular sound. (a sound that he knows I am trying to make a career off of)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": "top", "banned_at_utc": null, "view_count": null, "archived": false, "no_follow": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "pinned": false, "over_18": false, "all_awardings": [], "awarders": [], "media_only": false, "link_flair_template_id": "6740b348-cf01-11e9-b65e-0e5faddae3c4", "can_gild": false, "spoiler": false, "locked": false, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "visited": false, "removed_by": null, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_22x5u9", "author_is_blocked": false, "mod_reason_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "id": "1b3q322", "is_robot_indexable": true, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Objective-Maybe6805", "discussion_type": null, "num_comments": 0, "send_replies": true, "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "contest_mode": false, "mod_reports": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_flair_text_color": null, "permalink": "/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1b3q322/aitbf_for_not_letting_my_friend_release_a_song/", "parent_whitelist_status": "some_ads", "stickied": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheButtface/comments/1b3q322/aitbf_for_not_letting_my_friend_release_a_song/", "subreddit_subscribers": 103021, "created_utc": 1709284680.0, "num_crossposts": 0, "media": null, "is_video": false}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"approved_at_utc": null, "subreddit": "AmItheButtface", "selftext": "Okay context before I get into this..

D and Ri have always been there for me, supporting and taking care of me. 6 months ago we along with our group went to a club. That night I was suppose to stay with a friend (24F) as there was some issue at my apartment. But as we all got super drunk, she went home with her bf and Ri offered me to stay at his place and I agreed. I don't remember very clearly but I do remember us making out at one point of time that night. We stopped when I realised what was happening. It was very awkward the next day and I acted as I don't remember anything. But later on I did talk to him and asked him about it. Apparently he was so drunk that he didn't even remember it. So in the end we decided that it was just a drunken mistake and move forward.\nNow back to the main story. I have known Z for last 2 years. He was our college junior and is in his last year of college rn (He isn\u2019t close with Ri and D). Few months back he told me that he likes me and I decided to give it a chance. But we decided not to tell anyone until his college gets over. \nThis month he was visiting my city for a week. He was staying with his friends. We spend some quality time. On the last day of his stay, I threw a party and invited our friends. Everything went fine. At the end Ri and D were too drunk to drive so they stayed back. \nThe next day I was texting to Z and he said that he was really uncomfortable last night. I got worried so asked what made him feel so. But he wont give a clear reply. At the end I got annoyed and just said that this isn't the way to communicate and he would have to at least tell me what made him feel so for me to do anything. He got angry and said the reason should be obvious to me. My first thought was that he was uncomfortable because of Ri and I would have been understanding about it but till that point I was slightly angry due to him just beating around the bush. I tried explaining to him that there is nothing between us and we are just friends and that incident a drunken mistake. He started saying that there are other reasons as well. Though it was a major one. He had problems with D and Ri both, them taking care of me while I was drunk and obviously them staying back. But again this is nothing new.

D and Ri have always been there for me, supporting and taking care of me. 6 months ago we along with our group went to a club. That night I was suppose to stay with a friend (24F) as there was some issue at my apartment. But as we all got super drunk, she went home with her bf and Ri offered me to stay at his place and I agreed. I don&amp;#39;t remember very clearly but I do remember us making out at one point of time that night. We stopped when I realised what was happening. It was very awkward the next day and I acted as I don&amp;#39;t remember anything. But later on I did talk to him and asked him about it. Apparently he was so drunk that he didn&amp;#39;t even remember it. So in the end we decided that it was just a drunken mistake and move forward.\nNow back to the main story. I have known Z for last 2 years. He was our college junior and is in his last year of college rn (He isn\u2019t close with Ri and D). Few months back he told me that he likes me and I decided to give it a chance. But we decided not to tell anyone until his college gets over. \nThis month he was visiting my city for a week. He was staying with his friends. We spend some quality time. On the last day of his stay, I threw a party and invited our friends. Everything went fine. At the end Ri and D were too drunk to drive so they stayed back. \nThe next day I was texting to Z and he said that he was really uncomfortable last night. I got worried so asked what made him feel so. But he wont give a clear reply. At the end I got annoyed and just said that this isn&amp;#39;t the way to communicate and he would have to at least tell me what made him feel so for me to do anything. He got angry and said the reason should be obvious to me. My first thought was that he was uncomfortable because of Ri and I would have been understanding about it but till that point I was slightly angry due to him just beating around the bush. I tried explaining to him that there is nothing between us and we are just friends and that incident a drunken mistake. He started saying that there are other reasons as well. Though it was a major one. He had problems with D and Ri both, them taking care of me while I was drunk and obviously them staying back. But again this is nothing new. They have been protective towards me since always and even Z knew that. He even said that he doesn&amp;#39;t like me hanging out with them. It was then that I snapped and said that they are my friends and I am not ending my friendship because he was uncomfortable with it and it was some thing that he needed to work on. At last I said that we should end things if he doesn&amp;#39;t trust me. He asked if I wanted to break up. I said yeah I want to break up if he doesn&amp;#39;t trust me. He got angry and blocked me. \nSo AITB for ending things especially after he came to visit me? \nI&amp;#39;m asking this here because I sometime become extremely protective towards my friends.

It goes without saying that I&amp;#39;ll be saving these letters, but I&amp;#39;m not sure how many more of them I&amp;#39;ll be reading. Part of me wants to simply find a new box and seal up the letters again, but I&amp;#39;m a historian by profession and I&amp;#39;ve always been eager to learn how living through the Second World War affected both of them. It seems to me that this trove of letters is a resource that shouldn&amp;#39;t be wasted, but part of me wonders if I&amp;#39;d be a buttface for reading them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

One of these is people chewing loudly and the other is people biting their nails. For me it's like nails on a chalkboard and they are just sounds I can't be around. \n\nMy girlfriend bites her nails which is something I didn't realise she did often when we first got together but since we weren't living together. We were on a date once and she started biting them and I asked if she could stop and explained how much I hate the sound. She apologised and agreed to not bite her nail around me. \n\nWe moved in together 9 months ago and I noticed she was starting to bite them a lot more frequently. I asked her again if she could not do it when I'm around. She ended up getting her nails done regularly which meant she stopped biting them at all for a while. More recently though she's started biting even her nails even with the nail polish and whatever else gets put on them when she gets them done. \n\nShe'll do this on an evening when we're together. Last night I asked her again to stop biting them, we were sat watching tv and all I could hear was her biting her nails. She said it shouldn't be a problem but I reminded her of how bad the sound makes me feel. Later on in the night we're talking about something else and she just stops halfway through a sentence to bite her nails. \n\nI ask again if she minds not doing that and a min later she does it again so I walk out of the room. She asks where I'm going and I just say I'm not going to be in the room when she's biting her nails since she knows how the sounds makes me feel.

She apologised and agreed to not bite her nail around me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We moved in together 9 months ago and I noticed she was starting to bite them a lot more frequently. I asked her again if she could not do it when I&amp;#39;m around. She ended up getting her nails done regularly which meant she stopped biting them at all for a while.

We have ups and downs... but i always felt she was a disconnected woman. Perhaps her libido was down... dunno. I've talked to her about this, how it affects my self esteem, multiple times. We're in the 30s/40s\n\nOne day i found out she was texting a ex-worker, with a speech not really proper for friends. I got pissed off, she promissed me she would never speak to him again. Chance nr1.\n\nOne month later, i caught her speaking to him again... and planing to meet with him. She begged again... Chance nr.2\n\nOn eve of the new year, i found out that she had met with her ex boyfriend (along with a friend of hers, female as well)... to discuss a court issue over violence (on his part) where she was put as a witness. This has been going on since May. We didn't entered the year together... i had to get away. I was furious... but i relented... chance Nr.3\n\nToday was my 1st day of work after two weeks of vacations, with her. The first week was OK, she had booked a SPA at a thermal place for valentines for both of us. The second week she was distant. Claimed it was headcaches due to TPM etc... i've seen this movie before... but let it slide.\n\nSo today, she had her eyelashes done in the morning.

We&amp;#39;re in the 30s/40s&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One day i found out she was texting a ex-worker, with a speech not really proper for friends.

I was furious... but i relented... chance Nr.3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today was my 1st day of work after two weeks of vacations, with her.
