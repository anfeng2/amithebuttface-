48	adjudicated	NTB	Throwaway account so that I don't get witch hunted by my family on the internet.  For context, I (30F) recently attended the wedding of my stepfather and stepmother (our family tree is a little whack, don't question it).  SM has been around our family for 10+ years now and we all like her, so the wedding was long overdue. It was a destination wedding which was paid for by the both of them, flight and hotel included, so all I really had to do was pay for my meals/any experiences I wanted to engage in when I got there. I went over after they first announced their engagement to offer to do their wedding invitations as a gift, which they declined because they insisted they were going to have a small wedding. I said that was fine but asked if there was anything else I could do, because I was really excited about my SM finally officially joining the family, and they said they would "find some way for me to be included."  I had previously agreed to let my soon to be grandmother do my hair for the wedding, which I was very excited to have happen as I thought we'd have some fun together. She ended up coming to my room with nothing in tow, curled my hair, then immediately left because she wasn't feeling well. I didn't begrudge her that because she apparently hadn't been feeling great the night before so I told her to just go rest up. Come to find out a few hours later that my SM had invited nearly every other woman on the trip to get their hair and makeup done professionally with her the morning of in a group hangout except me.  Then in the actual ceremony, there was absolutely no mention of our families merging from either of them. Nothing about the fact that she would now legally have ties to multiple kids, nothing about sharing his love with us, absolute crickets. It is their wedding though, so it being focused around how they met and their life together makes sense, so I didn't say anything about it. Maybe she thought that since we're all grown adults that she didn't need to, I'm not sure.  Absolutely all of that wouldn't have bothered me in the end if they had actually spent time with me, with any of us for that matter, but they didn't.  No meals together, no outings, no "way for me to be included." As we would be waiting for one or the other of my siblings to join the party at large for heading to restaurants/events, my SD and SM would simply leave us behind. One of my siblings even tried to call them out on it in a group text and they didn't even bother responding.  I fully admit that I don't have much of a backbone so I didn't really pipe up about any of this bothering me. I just feel like we were a complete afterthought despite them having paid our entire way to be there, and I don't know if it just makes me sound ungrateful or not. If I'm at fault here I'm perfectly okay with acknowledging that. My feelings are just really hurt right now and it makes it hard to actually talk to them because I'm not good at hiding things.  Can provide more context if needed.
328	adjudicated	YTB	Throw away because I don't want this on my main  I (35m) moved to Ireland 1st of November 2023 and have been living here since. I've been on a room in a house in which the landlord lives. One day I was coming home from Tesco (a grocery store), when I came in the door my landlord's dog jumped up on me and made me almost drop the bag of groceries I was holding so I pushed the dog away and hit her on the nose.  Then my landlord walked in as I was shouting at the dog and ran over to me and asked what happened. I explained what happened and that he needs to train his dog to not attack people. He then started to get mad at me and I got nervous and lied and told him the dog bit me. He then told me his dog would never and asked my to show him the bite marks... so I panicked and told him to fuck off and that I fucked his mom and that he has no right to see any part of my body and then I left got in my car and went back to Tesco.  AITA?
67	adjudicated	NTB	My sister (33/f) is an alcoholic and doesn't think she has a problem. She binge drinks and becomes incredibly cruel and disrespectful to everyone around her. She is also very reckless.  My sister and I went on vacation last week. After dinner my sister and I parted ways. It was only 7;30pm but I was exhausted and I went back to the hotel and she went to a bar. She texted me around midnight saying she was going to another bar and would be back by 2am. Then I never heard from her until noon the following day. My texts went unanswered and she was not picking up her phone.  She did not know anyone in town and I assumed she was with someone random but I started seriously thinking about contacting the police to ask them what my next steps were because I was also thinking of worst case scenario. She is extremely vulnerable when she drinks and yet she thinks she is invincible.  My last text said "if I don't hear from you in a few hours I am calling the police." My sister finally texted me back at noon saying "huh? why the police? I am fine." Then she went awol again , ignored all my texts asking her when she would be back and didn't come back to the room until after 7pm.  When she got back she was unapologetic and resentful. She did not give any explanation as to where she was. She was mad I contacted our parents and she said I was dramatic for wanting to call the police. A few days later she had another outburst about this and she is mad I don't treat her like an adult and she said I watch too many tv shows.  AITB for being worried and wanting to contact the police? I know I am one for going on vacation with her in the first place. Those days are over.
374	adjudicated	EAB	 My stepbrother did this...   (Backstory:I used to live in Iowa with my mom before I moved out and moved to Georgia with my dad.-story for another day.   When I was female(11), I first started my "lady stuff." My stepbrother stole the used pads from the bathroom trash and had them in his pillow. They blamed it all on his autism. I had rolled them in multiple sheets of toilet paper like I was supposed to. I had just gotten out of the shower when my dad called me freaking out and screaming at me about how disgusting I was and how much of a perv I was. I did not understand. He then called back a few minutes later, crying telling me everything. He had told me about my stepbrother stealing my pads from the bathroom trashcan and hiding them in his pillow case. I don't get along with my stepbrother for that exact reason. I told my now ex about what happened cause he asked why I didn't like him. He told my stepbrothers girlfriend because I left my ex. My stepbrothers girlfriend left him. Today, my stepmother gets a call from him saying his girl broke up with him. My dad and stepmother come out screaming at me. They threatened to spread private pictures of me all over the school and ruin my life like I ruined his. They told me I was going to be forced to leave the guy I'm currently with. However, this is my first healthy relationship. He cares about me when shit is going down and doesn't judge. This is the first really healthy relationship I've ever been in. Things around my school do NOT spread fast. They're talked about for a couple of days, then completely forgotten. At the beginning of my junior year of high school, I went to a football game and had passed out and busted my chin wide open. People talked about it for a day, and then everybody forgot. My dad and stepmother said I was an attention seeker and a whore. Ever since I moved in with my dad, my stepmother has been very defensive and awful towards me. She pretends I'm not there when her blood children are there, and when they aren't, I'm all of a sudden her best friend in the whole world. I told my man about how my dad was going to tell my mom to go to my mans work and tell him I'm breaking up with him. I told my boyfriend about the situation and how everything was going to go down. He understood we are a long-distance couple, he's 19, and I'm 17. They told me that im too focused on my boyfriends. My therapist had told my dad that I was self obsessed and told him private stuff that I thought i could trust my therapist with. Am I the buttface??
41	adjudicated	INFO	Probably a stupid question, but I recently made a post on another website warning people that a popular adult in a few communities for a children's game has a thing for "romantic cannibalism." I don't mean that in a metaphorical or exaggerated way, they talk about it constantly and make extremely graphic self-insert content related to it. They have said multiple times that the smell of rotten meat in real life gives them butterflies. They also hang around minors in their private server who have the same/similar fantasies. I had a lot of people agreeing with me that it's a justified callout, but the actual person and their friends harshly disagree. I am, unfortunately, very easily manipulated so I'm doubting myself mentally if it was the right thing to do.
174	adjudicated	YTB	I (26M) recently got into a disagreement with my ex wife (26F), we shall call her Sarah (fake name), over a TV stand.  It all started when we moved in together in 2018. (for context, We live in the lower half of my family's house); Sarah brought **her TV stand** with her while moving in. Its quite a nice TV stand too, having a space heater in it. Anyway Sarah had got this TV stand in her last relationship and held onto it when they split.  Fast forward to February 2023. Sarah came to me and told me she wanted a divorce and I agreed that it was for the best. I began working on the paperwork and she moved out and into her parents house. This is probably where I feel like I'm somewhat being a buttface; I told her **she could leave her stuff at my place until she had enough room at her parents for her things.**  Over the next few months Sarah would come and grab boxes of items then go on with her life. When we got close to the Divorce finalization date, My family that I live with started asking me when she was going to finish getting her stuff out of the house. From that point I reached out to Sarah and asked "**would it be too much to ask for you get the rest of your items out by the first of August?**" to which she responded "**that's fine**".  We got to the point where we had our final divorce paperwork filled out and I gave her the copies and the originals to sign and **she read through it over the course of an hour before signing**. At the part about our property it says "We have already divided the property fairly. I ask the court to **order** that each spouse will **keep any personal property that they now have or control**". July came and then our divorce was finalized. With that finalization the Judge signed the papers and the court order would be enacted for us to "keep the personal property we now have or control".  **I still allowed Sarah to come and get more things until August**, however I stayed firm on that last date. She got **most of her things out before August and didn't ask about anything else she left**, including the TV stand she left here. Cut to 3 weeks ago, Sarah texts me "heads up, I'm planning on coming to get that TV stand in the next few months" and after a long time thinking about it and how **I never stood up for myself in my relationship or marriage**, felt like it was time to finally stand up and tell her no. We had a bit of back and forth banter texts that ended when I quoted the Divorce papers, and her telling me "You didn't tell me about that" and my final response was "You read the papers and signed them. It was not my job to tell you anything in the paperwork nor explain them to you."  So reddit, Am I the buttface for saying no she couldn't have the TV stand she left at my place?  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: After a few comments, Im glad to see that many people think im the buttface. As I stated in a few of the comments thus far, on the day Sarah and I had our convo, I took about an hour to reflect on myself and my actions. I felt like crap and a bad person, and for good reason. I was being petty and Vindictive, mostly over a more major argument months prior. I texted her again and we worked out a good time together for her to come pick it up by.   Reason for posting this after already resolving the issue, I wanted to share my story and see if others thought I was being a butthole or if others thought I was justified. Thank you guys for the comments!
209	adjudicated	NTB	 I live with my partner and in a couple of weeks, she's away for the weekend with work. I was thinking about what to do over the weekend and sked my best friend if he wanted to meet up and go for a few drinks. He lives in a different town so normally when we meet, I go to his and stay over and when he comes to my town we tend to only meet briefly and he'll get a taxi or a train home.  Since I have the place to myself I mentioned that he could stay on the sofa if he wanted so he could stay over a bit longer. I mentioned he could stay the full weekend if he wanted but the chances are that he would only stay for 1 night and go home.  I mentioned this to my girlfriend and she just said no. She said she doesn't want anyone staying in the apartment and that I can go and stay at his. I told her that I prefer going for drinks in our town since the bars are better. She just said he isn't staying over but wouldn't say anything else when I tried to ask why.  I pointed out she isn't even going to be here so it doesn't affect her and she just repeated that no one is staying at the apartment. She said he can always go home early but I mentioned that would mean he can't stay for long and that we were planning to go out to a few bars and it would be too expensive for him to use a taxi home.  She said I was being inconsiderate and that I should listen to her and that I'm being unreasonable.  AITB for inviting my friend to stay for a night or 2?
225	adjudicated	NTB	I  have been with my partner for 2 years. Sometime last year she was  talking about her friend who regularly looks through her boyfriends  phone and we both agreed it was an unhealthy thing to do and something  neither of us would do.  Last  weekend my girlfriend said she thinks I've been acting differently and  that she wants to look through my phone. I refused and mentioned our  previous conversation to her. I tried to get her to talk about how she  thinks I've been acting different but she refused. She said she only  wants to look through my phone once but I refused again.  The  thing is, one of my best friends has been going through some things and  he has asked me not to tell anyone. I don't want to betray his trust by  letting my gf see the messages and also I just see it as an unhealthy  thing to do.  I told my gf again  that I'm not letting her look through my phone but we can talk about why  she wants to but she refused and accused me of hiding things from her  and said it shouldn't be a problem for her to look through my phone just  this once.  AITB for not letting my girlfriend go through my phone?
231	adjudicated	NTB	I  have a range of hobbies from reading, being outfoors and going on  walks, going to the gym and playing video games. Working full time and  being in a relationship means I don't get a lot of time to do most of  them. My partner and I go to the gym together so that works quite well,  we go for walks throughout the summer when we can but my partner doesn't  like being outside in the cold so we don't really go for walks together  in the winter months and I manage to read on a night.  The  one hobby I don't really get a lot of time for is playing video games. I  play them for a maximum of 30 mins every few days when I get the time  but it can be hard when my girlfriend wants to watch something on tv for  example.  We both have 2 days  annual leave left to take before April. We already have a few things  planned before then that we've already put leave in for so I thought I  could use the 2 days left to just take a long weekend and relax and  catch up on hobbies.  I told my  girlfriend what I was thinking about doing and she said she thought we  could do something together. I pointed out all of the plans we have  coming up but she just said I should want to use my leave to do things  with her and that I am prioritising video games.  I  mentioned that I never really get time to play anymore so it would be  nice to have a couple of chilled out days where I can relax in the  apartment. I said if she doesn't want to do that then I'd understand if  she wants to make plans with family or friends when she chooses to take  her leave.  She disagreed and said  we should be spending the time together and that she wanted to make  plans. She said that I'm prioritising video games over the  relationship. I told her that's not what I was doing at all and that if I  was prioritising video games I'd have used the majority of the time off  for them but I haven't.  She just  said that I should be spending my time off with her and not planning to  use my last few days of leave playing video games.  AITB for "prioritising video games"?
11	adjudicated	INFO	(Ok the title is from the wrong perspective, but I didn’t know how to make it work with AITBA — to clarify, I AM the drunk friend here)  I went on a girls night out with friends I’ve known for about 2 years after a fancy dinner. I drank too much and threw up at the first bar we went to (not a normal occurrence for me at all, I’m emetophobic), so I decided I wanted to go home. My friends helped me call an Uber and I got into it/went home alone.   After I got home, I threw up a couple more times and my boyfriend took care of me. The next morning, he told me he was upset with my friends for letting me leave alone. He said if he were in their situation, he wouldn’t let someone very intoxicated leave alone, especially a woman (we live in a fairly sketchy area). I argued that I would have felt bad for ruining their night and they did enough by helping me call a ride, waiting with me, and texting after I got home.   Next month, I’m going to my first music festival (guess which) with the same friends and my boyfriend has expressed multiple times that he is concerned about my safety with them, because he isn’t coming along. We both grew up fairly sheltered while my friends are experienced with festival drugs, so he’s worried that I will endanger my own well-being. I’ve told him that I trust my friends AND I’m a responsible adult who can take care of myself, but he always brings up how they “didn’t take care” of me when I was drunk and throwing up.  I’m curious what the consensus on this kind of situation is — court of public opinion, what’s the girl code for when your friend gets too drunk and needs to go home? 
360	adjudicated	NTB	The other day me (29f) and my husband (46m) were having sex. After a bit, We started doing the 69 where I was on the top and he was on the bottom. There was a dim light on, so we could see in the room. He was doing his thing and so was I. when all of a sudden I tasted and noticed blood running down on his dick. It wasn’t a tiny bit. It looked like a lot, so I asked if I bit him accidentally. I knew I didn’t , but I asked anyway. He said, “no why?” I told him there’s blood. We went in the bathroom and I quickly washed my hands and started rinsing out my mouth, then brushing my teeth. I was turned off by the blood. It wasn’t from me.  He cleaned himself off and went to lay down. I thought he didn’t want to do anything afterwards. I didn’t want to either seeing that. I got in the bed and checked Google for what it can be and it said it’s possible to be a UTI. The next day when we woke up, I asked him does he think he has a UTI and he said, “no, I don’t burn when I pee”. I told him that that necessary doesn’t happen to people. There are different systems that happen to different people. I dropped it and didn’t bring it back up. That night he brought up the blood and said that I made him feel like he’s an infectious. I apologized to him. I seen blood and I was scared. I did t want it in my mouth and went straight for the sink. I didn’t make any faces or make any comments about it. Was I wrong for my actions?AITB? Also, I checked Google because I was concerned and I need to know the reason why it happened.
398	adjudicated	YTB	I have a friend whose 20 and recently said about an actress whose 20 "I'm simping respectfully" and it had me wondering is that creepy to be attracted to someone that age at his big age and reeks of older man lusting for younger woman.  I got weirded out by this and called him and out and said she's only 20 and you're 65 and she can't even drink and her brain isn't developed. My friend told me to calm down as it was just a throwaway but I wasn't having it and said he was being a creep and then he got offended and said i'm overreacting and its not a big deal. AITB for this?
266	adjudicated	YTB	She barely told me just an hour ago that she’s moving out this weekend. She’s at work right now and isn’t home, and since I only have 30 days to look for a new roommate, I went into her room to take pictures of it to put up for advertising to find a new roommate.   I didn’t ask her, but I needed to up the ad ASAP. She texted me that she has a camera in her room and to not do that, then sent me pictures of the room when it was in a better condition. It’s messy right now.   But AITB though? She’s moving out in a few days anyway so I don’t see why it matters.
59	adjudicated	NTB	I (20f), started going out with a guy "J" (21m) a few weeks ago. We met on a dating app.  My parents are very controlling, and me and my sister grew up afraid of telling them things.   I have struggled with mental health for years now, and I really don't have many friends to go out with. I've been feeling much better lately and it's good for me to go out and have fun.   I'm too scared now to tell my parents about J, so I always lie when I go out with him. Today I told them I'm staying in college with some classmates to finish a group project, and having dinner with them. But I'm actually having dinner with him.  I always feel guilty when I get home, but I don't know what else I can do.   Is it really that bad to lie in this situation?
406	adjudicated	INFO	Not so long ago I met this person on a online game after sometime we became friends for this I’ll name him Philip so Philip gifts me in game items that require real money in the end the total amount is equivalent quite a lot but he has became manipulating and toxic and I have no idea what to do. Yes I talked to him about it but it only made this worse
316	adjudicated	YTB	I personally believe that human beings are (as the title says above) egotistical and self-centered, but not always in a bad way. I often hear words and phrases like “selfless”, “altruistic”, “putting other people’s needs above your own”, et cetera and I just roll my eyes because I think that’s just an illusion. I think people do what they do ultimately to serve themselves, regardless if their actions intentionally harm or benefit others.   When I’m on social media like Reddit, Discord, hell sometimes even Instagram, I’m always seeing people being called out for having a big ego - but I bet the person calling them out has an equally if not bigger ego than they do, and wanted to feel good about themselves for putting someone else down. It makes sense, because people are more inclined to attack each other on social media because usually there’s little to no fear of retaliation compared to attacking someone in-person.  Let’s be honest with ourselves, we’re human beings and we all have egos, and our #1 goal in life is to serve and rely on ourselves. The one thing that we love and care about the most is ourselves, no matter who else in our lives we also love and care about. We will always put our needs before others. I’m not saying that we're incapable of caring about others and their needs (that’s the definition of selfishness/narcissism, not self-centeredness), but our needs will always be the #1 priority.  People often associate self-centeredness and egotism with bad things, but I think it’s directly related to good things too. People do both good and bad things for the same purpose: boosting their ego. For example, someone performs acts of kindness like volunteering or sending gifts to their friends because the positive feedback makes them think highly of themselves. One time I bought a cat-shaped stress ball for a friend who is a cat lover, and she loved it and gave me a hug. I bought it for her because I cared about her but it also made me feel good about myself especially when she hugged me. I mean, who wouldn't?  On the other hand, people may engage in dishonest, hurtful or even illegal behavior like gaslighting, bullying, blackmailing, et cetera because the feeling of wrongfully taking advantage of someone boosts their ego. It applies to people who commit atrocities as well, like mugging, assault, rape, murder, et cetera. I’m no criminal psychologist but we can’t deny that the potential notoriety resulting from them committing atrocities boosts their ego. Some people prefer to be feared rather than loved because they think it’ll boost their ego more than love would. A classic albeit fictional example would be Walter White, who committed atrocities to gain a reputation as a fearsome meth kingpin and to ultimately feed his pride and ego because he believed he would have otherwise died alone and forgotten.   I would like to know if I’m a buttface and I’m wrong, or if I actually have a point. I’m curious about how much my beliefs resonate with others.
379	adjudicated	NTB	I haven't seem my best friend in around 5 months as we live in different towns. We had made plans to go out for drinks and since there are a lot of good bars in our town, we said we'd make a night of it and go on a little bar crawl and probably go to a club at the end of the night.   I was talking to my girlfriend and mentioned the bars we were thinking about going to and she said it sounds fun. She asked if she could come along and I told her she can come next time but this time I just want to catch up with my friend, just the two of us.   She asked why and I just said I don't expect to go out with her and her friends whenever they meet up so there shouldn't be an issue with me meeting a friend. She said it seems like I'm hiding something but I just said that me wanting to see a friend on my own is not me hiding something.   I pointed out it's not healthy to expect to go on every social activity with your partner and that it's healthy to see friends on your own but she just repeated it seems suspicious and that she doesn't see an issue with her coming along.   I told her I've explained the issue, she's just choosing to ignore it but she just said I was causing an argument over nothing.  AITB for wanting to meet my friend on my own?
310	adjudicated	NTB	I live with my partner and in the future we would like to buy a house. We said it will not happen for at least 3-4 years. My girlfriend has a help to buy ISA and was given a lump sum of £5000 from family. She has saved £1000 herself.   I had money saved a few years ago but ended up spending it since I left work to look after a parent. Once I got back to work again I was on low paying jobs so didn't manage to save much. I have been in my current job for a year now and it's better paid so I have been able to start building my savings back up.   I would like to get a safety net before I start saving for a house specifically. My partner knows this and knows how much I want to save. My partner kept going on for me to open an account specifically for saving for a house and to match her savings. I told her I would open the account but until I have my safety net, I'm not saving large amounts each month in this account.   I told her how much I was planning to save and she said it was not enough and that I should save less towards my safety net and more towards the house. She mentioned that she is on less money than me and still manages to save more towards a house but I pointed out I have higher outgoings but she wouldn't listen.   She said I'm clearly not serious and it's not unreasonable of her to tell me how much to be putting in and pointed out how much she has saved. I just reminded her that £5000 of hers came from family so she can't claim to have saved it herself and she said I was being unfair and should be saving more.   AITB for "not saving enough towards a house"?
244	adjudicated	YTB	I (70M) have been spending the last four years building a biological preserve on an island off the coast of Costa Rica. My top geneticists have been extracting ancient dinosaur DNA from blood found inside amber-trapped mosquitoes and mixing it with frog DNA in order to clone dinosaurs to populate my park with. In recent times there have been a few incidents with workers on my island, so I've been forced to have an endorsement team visit my park.   The endorsement team consisted of a paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a lawyer, my two grandkids, and a stupid chaotician who thinks my park is doomed to fail. They toured the island, which had a rocky start, but suddenly my asshole IT technician turned off all the electric fences and ran away with my patented dinosaur embryos. Long story short, my lawyer has been eaten by a T. rex, my ranger and other technician have been killed by Velociraptors, and the paleontologist I invited to the island has decided not to endorse my park. AITB?
479	adjudicated	NTB	So I'm a trans woman, growing up there were a lot of signs. (I would list them all but that would make it hard to explain the actual story within the word count) A lot of the feelings stayed internal but some of them were expressed to people close to me, like my parents, enough that there was a point where my mom was worried that I was a misogynist because of some of the things I was expressing like my dislike of chivalry (turns out I didn't like it because having to participate in it forced me to be reminded I was a boy.)  She couldn't understand when I said that it just made me feel weird.  (Retroactively it turns out that it was pretty much the opposite of me being misogynistic) but my mom acts like me being trans came out of nowhere. Like it was something that suddenly happened without any warning, and then acts like I only feel this way because people on the internet pressured me to or whatever her excuse is at any given moment.  She's accepting-ish but not validating and has this habit of ignoring anything she doesn't love 100% about me and/or pushing blame of whatever on to what someone else told me to do.  When I came out as bisexual, it was also the internet telling me to be that way, when I told her I'm agnostic it was because of Goat Simulator and doing the side quests to get the “devil goat” form.   She has a bad habit of removing my personal agency when it comes to things she doesn't like, and I'm starting to realize that the reason I have a hard time trusting my own memories is because she does that.   In the case of my gender identity she says that all the signs I point out are things I made up retroactively, and that I didn't feel what I felt. Once again claiming that the internet told me to transition, or something like that… (as if I would suffer through the abject discomfort of my chest developing Because the Internet told me to :/ ) Anyway when I got offended at her making those claims she told me we should agree to disagree, and my response was that this wasn't something we can agree to disagree on, that she was questioning my individuality, memory, feelings and personal agency. I tried to explain to her that it's really offensive for her to try to tell me that my own experiences didn't happen, especially the ones that happened specifically inside of my own thoughts rather than being expressed outwardly. She's essentially telling me what my own thoughts were and trying to claim that she knew me better than I knew myself. We can have different perspectives I'm pretty much any other matter but when it comes to my own emotions telling me I'm wrong is kind of screwed up. Almost like gaslighting. Am I the Asshole?
446	adjudicated	NTB	To start off, I (32F) have ADHD and ARFID(where food textures causes anxiety). I’ve had both my entire life. Most people think I’m just picky but I usually can always find something to eat wherever I’m at.  For Christmas, I originally suggested for us to have a brisket and asked if my sister wanted to split it. My sister (35F) and my BIL declined bc of money so then said I would pay for it, given my ED/pickiness.   I drove 22 hours to be home for Christmas - fast forward to my sister calling me the day before Christmas Eve, she told me we were having pork ribs and bbq chicken. She said she knows I don’t eat pork (haven’t for 10 years) so she would make me bbq. I said thanks, but I don’t like bbq chicken and what happened with us having brisket?   She then proceeded to scream at me, calling me selfish and that I’m making Christmas about me and not focusing on my 3 nephews (her children). She then proceeded to bring up any drama we’ve ever had in our lives with one another(it’s always been a little strained). Calling me ungrateful and then continuing on about how my behaviors are unsafe to be around the children (I was just home for my 1yr old nephews bday in Oct and helped set everything up). And uninvited me to Christmas.    I rarely drink, I have a solid job and am well rounded IMO. I’ll admit I was a partier when I was younger but have grown and have been in therapy for the last year. She has even stated recently how much I’ve changed over the years. My mom asked for her to calm down but she continued on saying awful things and how I am flying off the handles when I wasn’t yelling. I raised my voice a little to try to get her to hear me because I was willing to just bring something else  After a day, I called and said I was sorry that I made her feel that I was ungrateful. I said that I was just wanting them to know that if they’re making this meal specifically for me, then to not do so because I wasn’t going to eat it. I felt that it would’ve been more rude for them to do that and then me not eat it.  She then reinvited me but said I needed to take the opportunity and prove myself to her to be involved in future family functions.  I declined because I felt this was very manipulative and gaslighting because I didn’t do any of the things she was saying I did and have nothing to prove to her.   Now she and my BIL are saying I’m ruining Christmas by not attending the family events and being there for the kids. I don’t feel comfortable having her analyze my breathing and don’t have anything to prove.   I feel bad for not going but also think I need to protect my peace. Am I the asshole for skipping out on Christmas?
383	adjudicated	NTB	Early on in the relationship I used to call my bf cute on occasion. I never meant anything bad by this, as to me calling someone cute means you both find them attractive and like cuddly at the same time.  However after a while he basically told me that he doesn’t like it because cute feels emasculating. I explained to him that I never meant it like that, but that I wouldn’t use that word anymore because I don’t want to upset him.  Probably about a month after this conversation, we were out on a date at a museum. After the museum we decided to take some pictures of one another outside with a new Polaroid camera I got.  I took a picture of him and we were both admiring it. I mindlessly said “Cute!” when I first saw it and told him that it looked good. I genuinely didn’t say it with bad intent, I just thought it was cute that I now had this lovely Polaroid of him.  He instantly said “What did you just say??”. I realized what I said and apologized right away, letting him know I didn’t mean to upset him.  He was pissed for the rest of date and kept saying that I purposely said it to make him upset. I do understand that I shouldn’t have said it, but I started to get pissed too because of how he was assuming I wanted to hurt him and was being cold to me after I thought we had a nice time in the museum. He started to accuse me of not even really liking him and said he could sense I was being off/weird in the museum. I thought I was being normal though.  AITBF here?
339	adjudicated	JB	I have been with my girlfriend for around a year now and I have met quite a few of her friends and I get on well with them. My girlfriend had plans to go to her friends house, lets call her Nicola for a few drinks and then go into town to a bar and club with her friend and another of Nicolas friends, lets call her Olivia. My girlfriend mentioned that I was invited if I want to come along since I haven't met this friend yet so I agreed.   When we got there her friend immediately said hello to my girlfriend and said nothing to me despite me saying hi. We brought drinks and she offered my girlfriend a glass for hers but again didn't even acknowledge that I was there. Olivia was polite and at least made an effort to speak to me.   Nicola kept talking to my friend about people and events that happened long before me and my girlfriend knew each other so I couldn't join in the conversation and as soon as my girlfriend filled me in on the details, Nicola would change the subject. This went on for the rest of the night.   The next morning my girlfriend asked what I thought of Nicola and I was honest and said I found her rude. I pointed out she made absolutely no effort to even speak to me despite me trying to make an effort and pointed out she went out of her way to exclude me from conversations.   My girlfriend said I was being unfair and that she wasn't bad and she'd done nothing wrong. I just pointed out that my gf had asked for my opinion and that I was only being honest. I mentioned that I like the rest of her friends but Nicola just seemed rude for no reason.   My girlfriend just said I was being harsh towards her friends and that Nicola is a really nice person.   AITA for giving an honest opinion of my girlfriends friend?
250	adjudicated	JB	So I (30m) was dating 28f. We used to live 1 city apart, in texas. Then I got a new job where I'd be traveling, and the home office would also be in a different city and state I'd have to move to (florida). It was literally my dream job, and was so much better than the job I had before. She and I talked about the new job, and being that it was a fairly new relationship, I wouldn't say her and I were "serious." I mean, I was serious about trying to make things work between us, but it just feels weird to call it serious that quickly (we hadn't even been dating a year, in fact we were only reaching 4 months).  We decided to take a step back and try to think things through apart, but this job meant everything to me, and would make for a better life for me, and for us if she decided to be with me. She, understandably, wanted to continue finishing grad school and staying in her career, but in the same town.  So, we went our separate ways, but stayed in touch. At one point, my work sent me to a fairly small town in upstate new york. My gf said she wanted to visit me, and I gave her the city where I'd be at. Well, she wound up going to New York City, and not to where I was. She then got upset at me because I was unable to meet her there. The thing is, my work provides us a rental to be shared by employees only and monitors how much we use the car, and basically, I'm not allowed to have a car more than 2 hours. Not to mention I'm also actually working the days she visited. (Maybe she thought I didn't work weekends?)   She got very upset and we argued about and I explained I am not risking the greatest job I ever had, particularly when I never agreed to travel to New York city.  It feels like to me she had a vacation planned for herself, and expected me to join without considering my responsibilities or limitations, or bothering to communicate any of her expectations in traveling. So, AITB?
150	adjudicated	NTB	A few months ago I dropped out of collage (after 2 years). There where a multitude of reasons that I don't really want to get into because they aren't really relevant. I moved back in with my parents. Because of where my parents live I'm very isolated and very rarely am able to see people my own age. I had Alot of friends at school and miss them every day. Two of my closest friends, let's call them Alex and Rudolf, are a couple and I talk to Alex almost everyday. I've known Alex and Rudolf from the first week of college. There is Alot of friendship drama that has to do with other friends I'm opting to leave out because it gets kinda convoluted and I don't think it's relevant. If enough people think it's nessisary I'm ok with recounting it. ANYWAYS, getting to the point my (21st) birthday is coming up and what I want most of is to spend it with Alex and Rudolf and some of my other friends from college. I don't live in that town anymore, but Alex and Rudolf do would it be totally inappropriate to ask them if they could host? I'm planning on offering 100$ convenience fee and I would of course help clean up afterwards. Write. On mobile sorry if this is unintelligible.
324	adjudicated	YTB	My boyfriend and I are long distance and see each other once a month. Recently, he flew to see me and on our last day, his return flight got delayed a few hours, so he texted me to ask whether I wanted to come downtown and spend a few extra hours together once I got off of work. As fun as it sounded, I worried traffic (about an hour) and rushing around would be too hectic to make an extra 3 or 4 hours worth it, so I declined. He went to the airport and left.  The next day, he told me that he was disappointed that I didn’t want to spend the extra time with him before his flight. He said that it made him feel unloved because we only see each other once a month, and it takes a lot of effort to spend time together, so it makes him feel unimportant. I told him that was not true, that I did care. I told him that I would have enjoyed hanging out during his return flight delay, but that logistically it didn’t make much sense. He said he understood, but that he would do anything to spend more time together if our roles were reversed and that it really sucked to be at the airport alone for several hours when we only see eachother once a month. I told him I was sorry he felt hurt, but that it was just bad circumstances.   AITB for not seeing long distance boyfriend during his flight delay?
311	adjudicated	INFO	Let me preface by saying I'm already in therapy for this , the thing is my boyfriend is a personal trainer and over the last year or so he has started posting content regularly on his personal social media and engaging with people from his gym regularly , specifically women he trains with and that leave flirty comments.   We've been on a relationship for over two years (best friends for 3 on top of that) and he always avoids the topic of posting stuff indicating he's on a relationship despite him posting about everything else in the same social media accounts , not just related to his work but personal things as well.    Now to the problem , he's started posting more risque photos of himself , that could be barely classified as 'physique photos/vids'' and the comments from women he interacts daily are super flirty to say the least , to the point where every time he gets close to me or tries to be affectionate the comments and flashbacks of his thirst traps flood my mind and make me severely disturbed. I can't shake this gut feeling and it's worsened to a degree where I have to hold back tears every time he tries to do something physical with me because it genuinely feels like I'm just an another ego booster to him and to me he looks like a public bathroom at that moment and I feel extremely guilty for thinking this and potentially sabotaging my relationship this way. My therapist only says I'm insecure but the road to actually fix this is not clear to me other than holding it in which my partner is able to tell ༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ.  I've tried telling him some people's comments make me uncomfortable and he unfollows then to please me (I don't ask for that) but them follows them again after a while. Please help ༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ
190	adjudicated	EAB	 On December 2nd my high school group chat was discussing their Spotify wrap. and they were talking about how everyone had Taylor Swift song lyrics on the slides. I made the heinous mistake of saying I did not like Taylor Swift. My exact words were, "I despise Taylor Swift."  Now, I have no evidence to believe she is a bad person, obviously, she has found some way to gain the system and make a hefty load of money. I've just never vibed with her music purely on the premise. I don't like the example of relationships depicted in her songs. Then I was forced to spend an entire summer listening to her, which did not improve my opinion, it worsened my opinion. (someone I volunteered with at my Tae-kwon-do studio had the TS station on every class) I explained all of this to back up my opinion. My taste in music is more akin to Maneskin and OUAT.  I was questioned on my use of language that was, "too drastic for the topic at hand." I do use strong language often, but it is to add variety in my writing. I also don't have any other artist that I can think of that causes the raging annoyance that TS does.  As expected, that angered the Swiftys at my high school. Someone looked up at least one, if not all, of the lyrics from the songs on my wrapped. And they found the cancel material they were looking for. My top artist of last year was Maneskin and my number 4 song was I Wanna Be Your Slave. This mysterious person started shit-talking me to a girl in my class, saying I was a hypocrite. I'm also the only known Catholic in my school so that was brought up.  Personally, I find this a tad bit amusing. Because I never claimed to be the stereotypical "good Catholic," and Swifties are unhinged.  But am I worthy of being canceled?
348	adjudicated	NTB	I (29yro female) have been working at my current job for over three years now, not without issues. One of the big issues is scheduling, which brings me to my current dilemma. My schedule manager has a habit of scheduling me on days I’ve previously told her I am not able to work. Usually I suck it up and just go into work because I hate the feeling of disappointing others. This included having to cancel therapy appointments and having to skip church every once and a while for a work meeting when I’ve had a no Sunday availability since I first got hired because I celebrate the sabbath. Recently, however my uncle has opened my dream store, literally a store we used to talk about as creatives. As a way to help, I work on Wednesdays since he also has a family no workers besides his 2 oldest who have their own jobs now. I told my scheduling manager that I wouldn’t be able to work on Wednesday’s at all at the end on November 2023. But recently has started scheduling me every other Wednesday. When I asked about it, I was met with hostility yet there are other employees who are given that day off and didn’t ask for it. Today is the first Wednesday I’ve been scheduled for a while so I put my foot down, messaged my manager and told her I wasn’t coming in because I previously told them I would not be able to come in on Wednesdays and will be prioritizing my family. My manager hasn’t answered me back since and now I’m scared to go in tomorrow. Am I in the wrong for sticking up for myself? Or should I have just buried my head in the sand once again and let them roll over me like usual? (Kind of wishing I did the last one)  Update: I finally quit. I got written up for switching my shift (with another supervisor and I got permission from my Assistant Manager who then denied it [isn’t the first time she’s lied to save her self]) I didn’t give a 2 weeks notice, in fact I just gave them my resignation and that was that. The job not only took a toll on my mental health, but it started to trickle into my physical health. On top of that, they belittled my inability to not work on Wednesdays by saying I didn’t show up just because “I didn’t want to”, then stating after I reexplained my reasons that it was a convenient excuse… I find it confusing because this was a second job for me, even if it’s my uncles store. Accommodations were also able to be made, the excuse they used is that they “couldn’t schedule people for so many day in a row” but the next schedule had them in for 6 days (Mon-Sat) where this one had them for 3 and 2 (Sun-Tues, Thurs-Fri). Lastly the last couple months were filled with verbal abuse. I got yelled at for not being able to come in when I had progressively worsening Covid. Even the staff was hit with “it’s like babysitting 101 in here” (70% new people, btw), being fired for being sick or living with a mental health condition when they were super hard and great workers who often got customer complaints, or being put down for not finishing 1/5 tasks (2 or 3 mini ones sprinkled in) given for the day even though the other 4 were done perfectly, yet without recognition. Worst part, this is just the last couple months, the full history of working here, the whole company is out of control. The fact that I stayed for 3 years boggles me as well as most of my friends and family.
452	adjudicated	EAB	EDITED!!  I (18F) have been riding horses my whole life. I met a friend, let’s call her Carly(17F) a few years ago who also rides horses. Last week, she texted me asking if I could ride her horse for her while she’s in Hawaii for two weeks, and of course I agreed. She brought me on a tour of the stables and showed me where everything was before she left.   The day she left, me and my boyfriend (17M) went so I could ride her horse for the 2nd time (she let me try on my tour of the stables to see if I would be a good fit) and all was well. The horse was pretty antsy, though, which made me nervous. Fast-forward 45 minutes and the horse went psycho and threw me off, leaving me in the hospital overnight with a moderate concussion and a fractured tailbone.   Carly texted me the day after, berating me about how things were left and so on and so on, to which I explained her horse left me in the hospital and anything left was by my boyfriend who knows jack about horses and was just trying to get me to the hospital.   Last night, she texted me again saying something of hers broke while I was using it and she wants me to pay for the whole thing. It’d be around $100 or more to replace the broken item, which ultimately only broke because her horse lost his sh*t and went buck wild for the fun of it.   My parents said to refuse and to in return, ask her to pay my mum for the clients she had to cancel to spend the morning in the hospital with me, which I thought was fair.   AITB if I don’t pay her back?   [EDIT] I feel like there’s a little bit of confusion around the events that happened that I wanted to clear up to give people a better image of what happened.   Moose (the horse) wasn’t nervous, he’s just a bit green and he was excited to get his energy out. I let him run around a bit before I mounted him because he has no knowledge of being lunged, has never been lunged before, and decided I was not the person to start that learning process with him. I was told specifically to ride him, not to lunge him, 3-4 times a week for two weeks.   Due to the concussion I got, I couldn’t text Carly and let her know about anything that happened because my parents hid my phone in the safe, knowing I’d go looking for it. The second I got it back, I replied to her dozens of texts about how disappointed she was in me and how careless I was.   I AM A CONFIDENT RIDER. I’ve ridden green horses, I’ve ridden horses with not much training. Moose has competed a lot in the past and I’ve seen him work, he’s an amazing animal, but something happened that day that made him snap.   It was out of the blue, there were no warnings. Of course I don’t blame him, because there was definitely something that must’ve made him do that, but I feel as though neither of us are to blame, and that nobody is, for that matter. It was an accident on everyone’s part.   I hope that helps some opinions in the comments. 
179	adjudicated	YTB	I have a friend who is going through some tough times with her job and associated financial situation. She’s under a lot of financial stress.  To cheer her up a couple of weeks ago, I took her to dinner at a very nice steakhouse; the tab was about $500 before tip for the two of us. I paid before she even had a chance to offer to pay part of it, and I told her not to worry about it. What was important was to have fun that evening and enjoy the treat, if possible.  I know having fun had to be a challenge. During our dinner, she mentioned that she was short on her rent. I asked her how much, and it turned out to be almost all of it. I sent her a Venmo for it without her having to ask, and I told her to pay me back “whenever you can, but don’t worry about it”.  At some point in the evening, I mentioned the trouble I was having with a contractor that was repairing the shower in my master bath. The previous fixtures had broken, and I had no choice but to replace them. I’m excited about the new fixtures that I have chosen; they are high end European things that are beautiful, and I am adding a rain head, audio speakers, and redoing the pan tile while the contractor has the wall open. It is practical to go ahead and upgrade everything at once.  I shared that I had cancelled a planned theatre trip to NYC because I couldn’t justify spending the money on the shower AND taking a fancy trip. She was surprised and asked me how much the shower fixtures cost, and I was open and honest with her – about $16,000 plus the labor cost for the plumbing and drywall. About $25k all in. I showed her photos of the new fixtures and the tile I had chosen.  She has mostly ghosted me since then. Through a mutual friend I heard that she thinks that I am tone deaf and insensitive for talking about a luxury shower project when she is on the verge of eviction. She felt the money spent on dinner was a gross display of excess. She even criticized the level of car service I chose to transport us.  I get it. It has to be personally trying to witness others living a lifestyle that is free of financial concern when for her every day is a struggle right now. But I have real problems with that. I think it is pure hypocrisy to criticize my financial situation while also taking advantage of it. If the restaurant choice made her uncomfortable, she could have suggested a more modest place for dinner. I can’t reconcile her characterization of me as insensitive while I am paying her rent.   AITB for "flaunting" wealth in front of my struggling friend, even though I tried my best to help her?
226	adjudicated	NTB	I  live with my partner and we divide chores 50/50. For the dishes we  alternate days for who does them and for cooking we used to cook  together. A couple of months ago my gf temporarily had her work pattern  changed so she started and finished later. This mean she was getting  back later so we agreed that I would cook for this period and we still  alternated the dishes.  3 weeks ago  my gfs pattern went back to normal so we said we would go back to  cooking together. I work from home but my workload has increased  recently so work has been more stressful and I've been working slightly  later. Every time it comes to food my gf will say she's tired and goes  on about how much effort everything is.  She  says she'll help and then once I've started she'll conveniently have a  nap. She's said it's because she's that tired she needs to but I pointed  out she shouldn't be getting as tired as she is each day so maybe she  should see a doctor about it but she refuses. It's started getting to me  that I'm stressed at work then expected to then go and cook for both of  us because my gf wants to go for a nap and then I still have to wash  the dishes 50% of the time.  I sat  down to talk with my gf yesterday and told her that I'd like her to  start helping more with the cooking since we agreed we'd both be doing  it and so far she hasn't helped once. She said it's not her fault she's  tired and I pointed out she only seems to be tired once cooking has  started and that if she isn't gonig to be helping with the cooking I  think she should be the one doing the dishes.  She  disagreed and said I was being unreasonable and that she does intend to  help but I just pointed out if she intended to help she wouldn't go and  lay on the sofa or bed when cooking starts. She said I was being unfair  and using her tiredness as an excuse to start an argument but I just  repeated that either she helps with the cooking or she does the dishes.  She said I was out of order and having a go at her for nothing. AITA for saying I am going to cook less if my girlfriend doesn't help out more or if she doesn't do the dishes more often?
17	adjudicated	NTB	I (M) (teen) have divorced parents. This is pretty common amongst society but my current situation requires advice which is the reason lmao.   So before my parents even got divorced my dad slowly treated my mother like shit over years of time. He didn’t make much money… he had no goals in life… yk what I mean. He sorta became a loser after marriage. So before my parents told they were getting a divorce they had already been divorced just waiting to tell me, therefore I was under the assumption that they were still together. So when my dad told me he was taking a yoga class with some girl I got concerned and told my mom leading to them having to tell me what was going on. And lil me thought it was because my dad was cheating. It was these small thing that would lead to big fights and put me in a bad mood. I’d go to school and lash out at people and eventually had no friends.   So my parents started a schedule where my dad had me 40% of the time and my mom had custody 60%. My dad tried fighting this percentage many times and each time got granted less and less. He started smoking weed and basically became a deadbeat. We lived in a Shity apartment where the fucking paint on the wall was half ripped off and he put no effort into bettering himself. No job. Even my young self started to notice he was a fucking loser. He would even hit me on occasions and there was nothing I could do since I had no control over the custody. Eventually over time my dad wanted no more involvement with me and straight up moved to a different country. I haven’t seen the guy in over a year not a single phone call nothin.   Today my mother confirmed my suspicions. My dad had been diagnosed with bipolar back in the court proceedings. He had been forced to get examined by the judge and they found out he had bipolar. (My mom isn’t really allowed to talk about the court stuff) which is why I’m finding this out now . Even if he has bipolar …. AITAH for still never wanting to talk to him again??????  Eventually his bad choices with money (he has always been horrible with money) will make him go broke ——&gt; moves back to my country. ——&gt; stays with aunt —-&gt; and I gotta see him (by law)   I am asking for advice …. I might be old enough to decline visitation should I? Also am I the ass here?  Thanks for your time 🫡👍

I have this friend named B who I met about a year ago, B &amp; I were good friends for a while.  However this all started in June when I was working during the Summer.  B was planning a party &amp; peer pressured me into going when I wasn’t sure, then basically ditched me when I was there.    Fast forward a bit cause school started, got ill, got diagnosed with a severe case of a  chronic illness &amp; still trying to get answers…also I had to leave school for 2 months due to my new chronic disability along with getting a wheelchair.  B has seen that I’ve gotten back to school, only for work though bc I can’t go to classes in person without becoming ill (flashing lights &amp; projector light is why).  Well B has been more clingy.  B has interrupted multiple times when I’ve been talking to students while I’m working, B even saw my prescription medication bottle, asking me really loud in the middle of a quiet event that I was working about it to the point where multiple students stared at me &amp; now knew that I take medication for a medical condition.    I feel constricted in this friendship &amp; with my responsibilities as well as dealing with my complex medical health, I’m just really tired &amp; I don’t feel comfortable continuing this friendship.  I’m worried it may cause issues but I also don’t think I should keep dealing with this either.  AITBF
378	adjudicated	INFO	There’s someone I used to be friends with. I’ve stopped talking to and hanging out with them because I don’t approve of their new partner. I’m not attracted to this friend at all, so I’m not jealous in this case. Their new partner has never done anything to hurt my feelings. Their new partner isn’t abusive as far as I know.   The only reason why I cut off contact is because the relationship goes against my values and beliefs. However, I never gave them any explanation for why I no longer keep contact with them. I never voiced my disapproval of the relationship. I never did anything to break them up.   Am I really the buttface for not keeping any contact with this person because I don’t approve of their new partner?
149	adjudicated	NTB	My best friend and I have been friends since the age of 10. From around when we were 18 we planned a holiday we wanted to go on when we could afford it. It's something we've mentioned throughout the years. We're now 28 and can actually afford it.  We were looking at doing late spring/early summer for this year and when looking at accommodation we found our best options were either going to be an airbnb or a hostel. The hostel would be a small private room with 2 beds as opposed to a large shared room.  I've been with my girlfriend for 3 years and she has knows about the trip we wanted to take. I mentioned to her that we were looking at taking it this year. She asked when we were looking at it for and I told her. She asked if she was coming and I said no it'll just be me and my friend. She got annoyed at this and said she should be coming with me.  I explained that it was a trip we'd planned for the two of us for years. She said I shouldn't be going away without her. She said we're going to be going out drinking etc in another country and it's wrong to do it when she's not invited to join. I mentioned that she's known about the plans for years and hasn't said anything.  She just repeated that she should be coming and that I should tell my friend it's the three of us going. I refused to do that and pointed out we'd still be going away later in the year. She said the trip is somewhere she's always wanted to go and I just said we could still go together but she just said she should be coming and that I shouldn't be looking at hostels to stay in either.  AITB for not inviting my girlfriend on holiday?  edit: just to add, my best friend is male since I don't actually think I mentioned his gender in the post.
22	adjudicated	YTB	Have  a close friend named Emily, who is currently dating Ethan. We’re all  really close, and we’ve talked about sex with each other before.  I’ve  had in depth conversations about all my best friends sex lives, it’s  pretty normal to share that stuff in close female friendships. Ethan is a  really private/reserved person, though. I heard from Emily that he  finds it difficult to be open with her friends (and his friends,  honestly) but he’s never been that way with me. We’ve always gotten  along really well. Emily was talking about their sex life on the  groupchat. She said she can’t have sex with her boyfriend as much as she  wants. I asked why and she said it’s too big, almost 8 inches, too much  for her to be taking every day. She said the sex is amazing and they  still do it often, but it takes more effort.  Our  groupchat had a lot of fun with this information, and with we all  started making big dick Ethan jokes, which she joined in on. It was just  a bit of fun.  Well, I was over at  her house and we were talking in the living room. We were drinking and  her boyfriend was asleep. It was late and he had work in the morning.  She  joked she can’t even sit down because she’s sore from the dancing and I  said “nah, it’s that eight inches, that Big Dick Ethan.” She laughed  and said “shut up,” which is our normal banter.  A  second later he walked into the living room, looking shocked. We froze  too. There’s a hallway between the bedroom and living room so he could  easily hear us, but we can’t see him coming out of the bedroom.  He  got a drink from the fridge and it was obvious he was upset. He went  back to the bedroom without saying anything to us, not even  acknowledging my presence. My friend said she would go talk to him and  be right back.  Well, she came back  30 minutes later saying when she admitted she told us about their sex  life (and yes his dick size) he broke down crying and is really upset. I  was horrified. I always figured he would take it as a compliment. Men  like being known as having big dicks? I left after that, but she was  crying too because her bf was upset.  I  feel terrible. AITA here? I feel so bad he cried. I should not have  made that joke, should I have? I didn’t know it was something men would  be upset by.
90	adjudicated	NTB	   Facts  We've been together for 4y. We have ups and downs... but i always felt she was a disconnected woman. Perhaps her libido was down... dunno. I've talked to her about this, how it affects my self esteem, multiple times. We're in the 30s/40s  One day i found out she was texting a ex-worker, with a speech not really proper for friends. I got pissed off, she promissed me she would never speak to him again. Chance nr1.  One month later, i caught her speaking to him again... and planing to meet with him. She begged again... Chance nr.2  On eve of the new year, i found out that she had met with her ex boyfriend (along with a friend of hers, female as well)... to discuss a court issue over violence (on his part) where she was put as a witness. This has been going on since May. We didn't entered the year together... i had to get away. I was furious... but i relented... chance Nr.3  Today was my 1st day of work after two weeks of vacations, with her. The first week was OK, she had booked a SPA at a thermal place for valentines for both of us. The second week she was distant. Claimed it was headcaches due to TPM etc... i've seen this movie before... but let it slide.  So today, she had her eyelashes done in the morning. In the afternoon.. she told me she was going to her father coffee. She told me he was more talkative than usual... oh well.  I found out she was not on her father coffee... she lied to me and went to visit some Big Brother VIP at her herb shop or something...  I'm finding very very hard to trust her, she asks me to think about what we've built together... but if we had actually built something of value, would she throw it away like this ?  So... Am I The Asshole ?
336	adjudicated	NTB	Ok so let me (37m) start by saying that we have had a small pause in our relationship a month before this happened. That had more to do with me wanting to take things slow, I have kids, a good job and a nice house. Meanwhile she (34f) didn't have kids, was unemployed and unwilling to move to my area. I was prepared to move but I really didn't feel like dropping everything within the first year of our relationship if she wasn't going to meet halfway. She did end up finding a job  So last week she was late for her new job so I didn't get to talk to her in the morning and as we were busy all day I basically couldn't contact her. I had a meeting with some other parents from my kids school With my daughter's birthday coming up I decided to meet with my ex (we are on good terms) in a coffee shop nearby before the meeting to discuss her birthday.  I sit my ass down and my gf finally sends a message and I tell her exactly what the plan is and that iam with my ex. My girlfriend just sends 2 texts: "WTF" and "ok" I try to contact her afterwards and the next morning because I knew she probably was jealous but I got nothing back at all.  For the next 1.5 days I receive not a single word and by that time I already decided that if she wanted to talk about this she had enough time to do so. So I finally confront her basically going in with the fact knowing that this would end but I gave her the time to talk about things. She told me that she doesn't know how to deal with my kids because of my ex and vice versa. So I told her that if she gets between me and my ex if we have a conversation about our kids you are actually coming between me and my kids and that's a line I wouldn't let her cross and finally that she crossed a line when she just vanished without saying a word.  So she said she probably wouldn't be able to deal with my demands and I told her that it's over. Since then she has became very apologetic and wants me back. I think I did the right thing but iam still wondering if I could have handled this differently perhaps. She's an amazing person otherwise but I can't keep dealing with her mood swings.   Tldr, gf jealous of my ex because I met her to discuss my daughters birthday, gf just vanished and I decided that I couldn't deal with that.
306	adjudicated	NTB	This happened when I was 14 or 15 years and to this day, I don't know whether it was a very bad joke or assault. I'm a female, by the way.  One time, after recess, I said goodbye to my friends and I was putting my jacket in one of the coat hangers when suddenly, out of nowhere, a boy put his hands on my hips.  Now, this boy in particular was one I didn't get along with, mainly because he used to pick on me and my friends from time to time. He was the "class clown" and sometimes picked up on people or made fun of them just for shit and giggles. He was never truly physical, more like verbal harassment.  Anyways, this guy out of nowhere, put his hands on my hips, rubbed his dick along my butt and acted as if we were having sex, saying "Oh, yeah, fuck me in the bed!" and moving as if we were fucking.  I was disgusted to say the least, and quite scared, so I inmediately pushed him away. He fell against the coat hanger and he let out a dramatic scream, making some people turn around their heads and laugh at what was happening.  One of his friends came up to me and told me "Blue Dandellion, what are you doing? Leave him alone!" and him and the one that grabbed my hips pushed me against the blackboard until the teacher came.  I felt so humilliated and embarrassed and inmediately left to the bathroom to have a good cry. I always thought it was a bad joke so I didn't tell anyone what happened until one year later, when I told my parents what happened to me. They were absolutely angry and told me I should've told them sooner.  Even so, those people laughed and it's not like we were naked or anything. We were fully clothed. And when they pushed me against the blackboard they kept laughing mockingly and giving me nasty glares.  I used to love when people I care about hugged me from behind but ever since then, when someone does that, I can't help but tense up a little bit.  So AITBF for pushing that boy away? Were they just joking and this was a joke of a very bad taste? Was I being dramatic? Or was this some type of assault?
204	adjudicated	NTB	It has been 3 days since our argument and barely talked to me. My boyfriend 26m asked me 24f to come to the mall with him at 1:00. I agreed but we both knew we had to pick our son up at 3:45. He's driving to the mall (which is 15 mins away in an area we grew up in) and he's not really talking to me. I ask him what's up and he starts talking about the situation from my previous post. But he's explaining how I wasn't being understanding, and he only yelled because he was tired and he had to argue with our 4 year old to go to bed.  I had no idea he was tired, he said he was going to take a nap before I got home. And from the time I hung up the phone to the time it took me to drive home, our son fell asleep with in at most 20 minutes. Which is super fast for our son. Regardless, I didn't think it was cool for him to suddenly yell at me without any explanation. And when I explained that the nights before, I spoke in my normal tone.  Anyway, I explain all this and another argument ensues. We're talking back and forth for like an hour in the mall parking lot. Were mainly talking about the other night and how he thinks I should have been understanding. And when i try and explain myself he says thats not even what hes mad about. I'm starting to get really frustrated arguing for so long in the car with the windows up.  I try to change the subject by asking what he's even mad about but that doesn't work. So I start telling him I'm getting frustrated and need a break from the conversation, since it's been an hour. He keeps talking and I get frustrated asking to end the conversation so I just say "I'm frustrated and instead of yelling at you I'm taking some space. Please pick up our son, I'll meet you home." He says no and I leave and go into the mall. @2:36  He's texting me asking me to come back but I'm so mad, I just text I'm taking space so it's not a screaming match. I walk around and I'm still mad by 2:50. So I just call an Uber so I can get to my car on time to pick up my son. When I'm in the uber I text him and tell him I left because I was too frustrated to be stuck in the car arguing with him again and I needed to pick our son up.   My logic was that if I was still mad when I got in the car I would end up yelling at him. The he'd say if it was okay for me to yell, why are we arguing about him yelling at me. But if I just didn't talk, he'd say I'm giving him the silent treatment and not communicating=me being disrespectful. So i opted to Uber home to calm down, pick our son up on time and he could still shop for his pants. He knew the area because he has lived in this city his entire life and he drove his own car. I wouldn't have left if I knew he wouldn't be fine.  Now he's saying I abandoned him and that if I ask anyone they'll say I was disrespectful. But I thought it was the best choice. My only regret is asking him what was wrong in the first place. AITBF?
286	adjudicated	YTB	My BF(28M) and I(27F) have been dating since high-school. when I was 18 my parents kicked me out of school because they believed turning 18 means I should be independent now, with no where to go my bf dropped out of university after 1 year and took me in, he worked full time to put me through university and feed me. I graduated and started being a housewife.  When my Bf turned 28 last week he had a mental breakdown it was the first time I have seen him emotional about anything, he was worried about turning 30 and not finishing university, making him believe he was an idiot, i don't see how this can be an issue to anyone but whatever.   Last night my bf came up with a plan he suggested I start working using my masters degree so he can go back to university suggesting we switch roles for the time being so we can both build a happy wealth family. I gave his plan some thought but I needed an outside view my friends all told me that my Bf is just using, manipulating and forcing me to return a favor. I do believe I should not be working to support someone who "Choose" to help me out   I am grateful for my boyfriends help after all this time but I am not going to waste 4 years of my life supporting him to get an engineering degree. WIBTA if I dump him?  &amp;#x200B;
489	adjudicated	NTB	   RECAP: Got yelled at for copying when I didn't mean to, apologized over and over and didn't have it accepted.  Okay, so I apologized again, but that didn't work. I apologized again, tried really really hard and got "I appreciate it and I understand that you didn't mean to hurt me" from this ex-friend.  You heard right, ex-friend. I stated there that I would leave them alone and give them some space, and went about my life like I had to. I've been depressed for the past few days, but I've tried to get on with it. And then today they blocked me. When I went to Facebook to ask what was wrong, they yelled at me for recovering too fast and being okay when I hadn't done enough to atone (even though I literally paid them $600 and apologized over and over and asked what else I could do, and abandoned a story I was proud of). Apparently I'm not allowed to talk to the group and send pics of Christmas trees to people who are not involved in the fight. And now they've dumped me as a friend and they hate me because I tried to get on with life and my depression didn't come across. What was I supposed to do??? I'm heartbroken and I keep crying. I usually never cry loudly, but tonight, I howled.  AI still TB?
284	adjudicated	JB	Would I be the buttface if I asked my room-mate to start taking shorter showers.  I 28 f share an apartment with 20 f. We share one bathroom between us.  My room-mate takes a long time in the bathroom, frequently she'll be in there 20 minutes or so just for brushing her teeth, getting ready etc.  at least 2x a week she will have the bathroom for 40-45 minutes at a time, these seem to be hair wash days. I know this because upon exiting the shower will be coated in her coconut conditioner...which leaves a slimy residue everywhere---I think she must be wet-combing because it's flicked all over the walls. I have very different hair to her, so my shower routine, even on my hair wash days is generally 10-15 mins max.   WIBTB if I asked her to consider having shorter showers, or being more conscious of water consumption; running a hot shower for 20 minutes + every other day is in my opinion actually wasteful, I pee a lot, and its agitating having to worry about planning my time to pee in case she goes in there for 40-45 minutes when I need to go... is she actually taking a long time, or does it just take that long to wash thicker hair? 
473	adjudicated	NTB	Visiting in-laws abroad. Before we left home, we made plans to do a Christmas themed meal popular for this culture at a specific venue at lunch tomorrow. I packed accordingly for all my planned activities as I like to travel light. Now I find out my FIL changed the venue and the time from lunch to dinner without informing anyone. I don’t have suitable clothes. I’m also pissed off because he does this kind of shit often. What if I had other dinner plans now? You can’t change shit up on adults and just assume they’ll go along. But my husband is his only child and he very much has always treated him as a helpless child who can’t think for himself. Am I a buttface if I decide not to go tomorrow? My choices are either buy something to wear and go or pretend to be sick and lose a whole day here. My husband said being honest (which is always my preference) is not an option here because it will hurt my relationship with his dad. I wouldn’t give a shit except we have to come back here in May for an event I want to go to so maybe best not to rock the boat.
275	adjudicated	YTB	I (18F), recently delved into a relationship with someone I'll call Tom(23M) for privacy reasons. Tom and I met at an event and hit it off right away. We share the same interests, have similar music tastes, and our view of the world and everything in it is not far off.  We started dating for a while, but recent events, a story for another time, pushed us to our limit and we broke up, but still kept a casual relationship with each other. While we were dating, he was super open about his past, specifically his past relationships including his relationship with his ex, whom I'll call Maggie(22F). Tom and Maggie have been in a relationship longer than he and I had, and during the time we were dating, he still kept in contact with her and even goes out with her sometimes, which is fine for me, as he reassured me that they were just friends.   When Tom and I broke up, I found out that when he and Maggie broke up, he also kept a casual relationship with her, but he swore that nothing happened between them when we were together and that he kept his distance in respect for me.  Well, recently, I came over Tom's house a couple of times because staying at a house with my family is not a good option for my mental state rn. He and his family was very accommodating, and I tried my best to keep my distance with Tom as we were already broken up, but every time we were in the same room along together it seems as though we peak in our weakened state. That's how the casual relationship happened.  I came over a few days ago, and he asked me out of the blue if it would be okay if I won't come over for the next few weeks because Maggie will be at their house and would be working for them for the time being (renovations are underway, Maggie is an designer). I didn't respond but inside I was feeling a bit jealous because I am still in love with this dude and knowing that something other than work would be happening to them when we recently just broke up hurts me tbh. I know I have no right to feel this way but would I be the buttface if I continue to feel jealous of them?
368	adjudicated	NTB	So I (23m) have a sister (18f). She has some animosity towards one of her teachers, because the teacher leads an extracurricular music group, and has not chosen my sister in all 4 years of her high school. My sister is very passionate about music, and feels the teachers judgment was unwarranted. I'm not really musically inclined, so I'm not the best person to ask if these assessments were valid.  However, in sort of whirlwind of events, I would up meeting that teachers daughter  (21f). I didn't even realize that this was the same family at first. The thing is, we really hit it off. We are both very passionate about horses. I often maintain my parents' stables and she often volunteers at local horse stables.   When we decided to officially date, I introduced her to the family, and my sister, livid, said, "I can't believe you would bring HER to this house."  I understand my sister has some animosity towards my gf's mother, but whether or not my sister has valid feelings, my gf has absolutely nothing to do with what happened.  So, AITB for dating my gf, or WITBB if I continued to date her?
122	adjudicated	NTB	My friend Liz (fake name 21f) and I (21f) have been friends for almost 2 years. we met through a mutual friend, let’s call her  Sam, who acted as the glue for our friendship. we only originally would hang out because of Sam. Liz and I are pretty different, we value different things politically, religiously, and personally. She has an amazing relationship with her family I didnt. she loves god, i dont (atheist w religious baggage). we do have some things in common though, love for certain TV shows and speaking up for our values. we would have many tiffs over things like abortion, gun rights, and other heavy topics.   she also had a tendency to make many small jokes that are harmless on their own but build up. like pointing out any minor mistake i made, my reading disability, pointing out physical insecurities and things like that. she also self proclaimed to be the “main character” while we were her supporting cast. she would police our outfits for queerbating, despite us all being queer just not out. the only larger thing Liz did was tell our friend group that we caused her to be sewerslidle and call the hotline due to not inviting her to hang out with us that week which we did upon her request bc of her work load. she never did anything big but everytime i finished hanging out with her i felt insignificant, and stupid, which was starting to ware me out.   fast forward: we were all chilling at my dorm which i shared with 2 of the members in our circle. i cant remember what made this come up but Liz started joking about me secretly being a furry, having fursonas, and being attracted to furries. in the past she pushed that joke way too far and tried to say i was attracted to animals which is just disgusting. i dont want this to happen again so i continuously told her to stop but she kept on joking. i was having a bad day bc my dog died and said to the group “i can’t do this right now.” and left to my room  a bit later i get a text from her apologizing for the joke and i replied saying needed some time. we had a group dinner planned which i didn’t want to go to due to my dog being put down that morning. she complimented me and i brushed her off bc i was still upset. i didn’t initiate any conversation with her which made her upset.   the next day Liz asked mutuals to ask me to meet up and talk and i told her again i needed time. they asked on her behalf again and i ended up sending a text formulating my thoughts and feelings. i described how i felt a bit incompatible, and that many of her behaviors hurt me and me not communicating better has caused me to hit a breaking point, which is my fault. i ended up asking for a break and saying i need time to fix my insecurities because i know she didn’t intend to impact me that way. she replied very upset and through the grape vine i heard her telling a bunch of people i was a sociopathic narcissist due to my response
459	adjudicated	NTB	So here’s my issue, on the 23rd one of my niece’s pet rats died and in early December my mother’s pet bird which she raised from a hatchling died in a terrible accident. So it’s safe to say this December has been a very grief filled one, the whole family has had it very hard because of how attached they are to their pets.  Now onto the problem, one of my cats has died. He was somewhat old, not well, and while everyone else didn’t really realize it, I knew his time was probably going to come sooner rather than later. On the 23rd - the same day the rat died - I found my cat had died in his sleep. It’s now about 16 hours later and I haven’t told anyone, his body has been wrapped and placed in a cardboard box and is out on my balcony (I live somewhere with extremely cold winters so decomp isn’t something I’m worried about atm) The vet offices are closed for the holidays now, so bringing him in for cremation isn’t an option unless I bring him to an emergency vet and well, I’d say the emergency is over at this point.  It’s Christmas Eve and I don’t want to upset the family more, but I also feel terrible because they don’t know why I’m looking upset (I say it’s just a bad day) meanwhile I have my dead cat hidden out in the winter air on my balcony away from the family. It’s a terrible situation, things shouldn’t be allowed to die at Christmas time but unfortunately the universe isn’t that kind.  WIBTB if I waited until after Christmas to tell the family about my cat, sparing them the pain of yet another loss?
366	adjudicated	JB	Edit: wanted to see if this makes a difference the tickets weren’t being sold yet and there were only estimated prices. Don’t have much experience with trips or concerts, grew up sheltered and they knew that I never experienced these things. The concert is next month and the price is above the estimated price given last month. When inviting them to my place, I told them what week I’m free and no response other than cool. I can totally see me being the butthole.   So i 27f  made friends with a group of awesome girls and i used to hang out with them a lot bc we had the same sport/hobby but that sport has gotten too expensive and i dont hang out with them bc i do a more affordable sport. Financially it’s been tight and my career is very unsure for the next few months. I have cancelled a lot of plans with them before. Last month I wanted to go to a cool concert but today I saw the prices and the location. Calculated the drive, the cost, time it takes for everything, and my energy battery. It’s not looking too good for me. So I cancelled once again. I can tell they’re annoyed and I have apologized plus asked if we could go to a different closer and affordable concert. Also they should totally go to the concert and have fun. I let them know that I’d love for them to come over and hang out at my place. I know they were looking forward to the plans. Feeling super guilty for canceling again.
472	adjudicated	NBH	Would I (15) be the tah if I were to ask my brothers (12 and 18) not to call our ex-abusive father in me and my elder brother’s shared room?  For context, my father was emotionally and physically abusive before my mom and father divorced nine years ago. The girls—me and my now-ex-sister—had it worse than the boys in terms of abuse. They were still abused; don't get me wrong, but me and my ex-sister were abused more often and worse. Me and my ex-sister cut contact, but my brothers have not.  My brothers think my father has changed, but I frankly don't want anything to do with him. They call and play video games with my father regularly, which I don't mind since it's their relationship, not mine, but I'm tired of having to listen to them talk like nothing happened. It makes me feel like it's not my room or that I'm overreacting to the whole thing, but I really don't want to endure it anymore in my own comfort zone.  I want to ask them to not call my father in our room and to limit their time playing video games with him to somewhere near 2 hours. I don't want to muffle or lessen their relationship with my father unpurposefully, but I can't take the constant stress of this anymore. Would I be an asshole if I asked them to limit their time talking or playing with my father?

318	adjudicated	NTB	Last month, during New Year's Eve, my(38F) friend(35F) proposed a double date idea. The plan was to have a nanny take care of our children while we enjoyed our evening. She has two daughters, ages 3 and 6, and I have a 10-year-old son. Interestingly, my son and her 6-year-old are quite calm, but her 3-year-old can be quite a handful. The evening turned out to be wonderful. However, when it was time to pay the bills, my friend suggested I cover half of the nanny's fee. This left me pondering. Given that the nanny was primarily looking after her two younger children, and my son, who is older and less demanding, was there too, AITB to feel that her request was a bit unfair? I do appreciate her effort in organizing the evening, but I'm seeking an external opinion on the appropriate etiquette in this situation.  Couple of things to clarify: I've already settled the amount my friend requested for the nanny's services. I acknowledge that it would have been better to discuss this arrangement beforehand. The nanny's charges were based on an hourly rate. My spouse and I provided transportation for both couples to and from the venue in our vehicle, which didn't require extra fuel. The nanny looked after the children at my friend's house.
213	adjudicated	NTB	My girlfriend is working part time while she finished university. The place she works is only until she leaves university and finds work somewhere lese full time. It is a small team of around 7 people. She recently got a promotion which she was happy about.        She has to shadow another member of the team who does the same job she will be doing. They get on well but she's mentioned that other people at work have commented on him liking her and saying they seem like a couple.   She also mentioned that he spend a lot of time complaining to her about his girlfriend and his relationship. According to my girlfriend she's the only one he complains about his girlfriend to. He also refuses to invite her to work events where peoples partners are invited.         They have each other on social media and will message a bit outside of work. It started sounding like he was getting too close so I told my girlfriend I was starting to feel a bit uncomfortable since it looks like he's clearly interested in her and other people are picking up on it.        She asked what I wanted to do and I said to just maybe remind him to keep things professional and not to message as much outside of work possibly and then when she's not shadowing him to maybe put some distance between them so he doesn't get the wrong idea and to make sure things remain professional.         She got annoyed and said no and that she shouldn't have to do any of that since nothing is happening between them. I said I know that but I don't really want it to get to the point where he tries anything with her. She accused me of not trusting her which I told her was not true. She told me to keep out of it and that I was out of order for telling her how to act around a colleague.        AITB for voicing my concerns about my girlfriends colleague?
455	adjudicated	NTB	I know I sound so spoilt but let me defend myself. I (16F) live with my sisters (10F) and (5F) and my mum. My dad, who isn't usually in the country, and my mum, whom I love dearly and talk to constantly, has her flaws as she is human but so do I and I don't care cause she's always there and I love her for it. Anyways, she does this gimmick every year that she isn't getting us any presents but because of how things were going this year I actually believed her and accepted the fact that I wouldn't get anything this year because I don't mind going without presents as I have done so before on birthdays and Christmases and it's ok because I understand it is slightly immature of me to expect something always.  This Christmas I got 30 pounds from my grandparents and I spent this and the other 20 pounds I have saved on presents for 8 different people by the way because aunts and grandparents and whatnot came to visit. I don't have a job so this was all I had. When we unwrapped presents I gave everyone their presents and I got three presents: nail polish with 3 pounds and a perfume. Which, I was grateful for until I saw what my sisters got. The perfume I got was at most worth 20 pounds and I could tell wasn't very well-thought-out my sister's presents were worth around 60 pounds ish each and they got a joint present that was about 70 pounds.  I want to emphasize that my problem isn't the price, although that does add insult to injury, the problem is that it clearly wasn't bought with me in mind because I don't want any actual perfume and have never expressed wanting any and I talk about my nail obsession constantly AND I've been a bookworm basically since I came out of the womb. These things aren't very expensive and could be around the same price so they really had a vast choice of things to buy. The gift I liked most was the nail polish and 3 pounds from my sisters which was less expensive but clearly was thoughtful and bought ACTUALLY with me in mind. It just hurts because I spent hours agonizing over what to get my family members and it feels like they smelt two perfumes and chucked this one in the cart because it smelt nicer. I just want to clarify I still tried my best to act as excited as I possibly could because I am not a complete ingrate but I couldn't hide my disappointment.  Also, I am autistic and both my parents know this so I can't always produce the best reactions. Also, I have special interests (nails, ballet, psychology, and books) which I won't stfu about but I didn't get anything related to those things. Anyways, my parents could see my visual disappointment and seemed upset that I didn't like my presents and I feel really bad about it because even if the gift wasn't necessarily thoughtful at least they got me one, you know? This was a bit of a rollercoaster but I just needed a second opinion and I know teen hormones affect my better judgment so Reddit, Am I The Buttface?

Our neighbour downstairs however, is very distant. She is a woman in her 30s and barely nods when we say "hello!" when we see each other in the driveway. Which is totally fine btw, never had a problem with her and she never makes noise.  However, yesterday she had her mother(i suppose) and a female friend/sibling/relative over for visit. Where they had brought their dog with them and let it run freely outside. We didn't know of this until our two cats came running back inside through our front porch door, which we have open slightly so the cats can go in and out, and in the gap was the dog barking and trying to enter our house through the gap in the door, but luckily the gap wasn't big enough and we scared it away.  We contacted our landlord first and she literally said, try to talk to them or call the cops (quite extreme that one).  While talking to her, we saw the dog ***(AGAIN)*** outside our office window taking a shit there.  We then went over to our neighbours and questioned them politely why they let the dog run freely and if they could keep it in a leash or inside. In which we only got met with a sigh and a chuckle from the mother and the relative saying in a confrontational tone *"its friendly and only wanted to play with the cats"*.  This resulted in us getting quite mad and decided to just leave and call the tenants landlord complaining about the situation which ultimately ended with them calling her, telling her she needed to kick them out because dogs are not allowed in the apartment and gave her a warning for letting it run outside causing us trouble.  It might have damaged our relationship with the tenant/our neighbour, and she didnt even say anything when we went over, it was her guests that took the freedom to talk and do as they pleased. So I feel a little bad for her but I also feel she should've taken more responsibility. AITB?  TLDR: I(24m) complained to our neighbours landlord for letting their guests dog run loose in our shared garden and chase me and my gfs(22) cats while trying to enter our apartment, in which resulted in her getting a talking to (possible written warning) and her guests/family thrown out. She(our neighbour) is very introverted, never has parties or makes any noise. But possibly afraid of conflicts with her relatives, who refused to apologize and told us "the dog is friendly and only wanted to play with the cats".

97	adjudicated	NTB	My girlfriend and I mentioned we wanted to have more quality time together without using phones etc. We said we'd go on more dates but also have more nights in where we choose a movie to watch and get popcorn and other snacks etc.   At the weekend we chose a movie and my girlfriend kept picking her phone up and scrolling social media. I asked if she minded not using her phone since it was supposed to be the point of us spending time together and not using phones. She said she's not on it long so it shouldn't matter. She kept picking it up again and scrolling social media so I paused the movie.   My girlfriend said that's not necessary and to not pause it. I asked her again if she'd stop using her phone and she said she wasn't using much. Around 5-10 mins later she pick her phone up again and scrolls social media. At this point I turned the movie off and said she clearly wasn't interested.  She accused me of ruining the night by turning it off but I just pointed out she obviously didn't actually care about watching the movie since she spent more time on her phone. She just repeated I didn't have to turn it off and that it was me who ruined the night.  AITB for turning a movie off?
104	adjudicated	NTB	I (16F) am in the band and I love it more than anything and would do anything for band and I look out for my fellow band mates.  Yesterday I was in band and one of my band mates (who we will call Gianna) was doing certain things incorrect and we politely corrected her saying “Gianna, can you please play a bit softer?” and just things like that. But she kept rolling her eyes at my section leader and ignoring us so it was my job as leader of second altos to help out, so I gently told her to fix certain mistakes.  But she gave me the same attitude so after class I talked to my band director in private; this is where I think I may have been in the wrong, so i told my band director about her attitude towards us and he understood and told me a way to help us. I let my section leader know today that I spoke with our band director (which he says is the best thing to do), but my section leader said that it wasn’t my place to say what happened.  I would like to say that I did let him know that how we worded things may seem like we were being rude or anything like that and that it isn’t our intention to make her feel bad.  Reddit, AITB?

65	adjudicated	YTB	I (F 18) have been flirting with Paul (fake name, M 21) for a couple months as I thought he was really cute. We only know each other through our college and my flirting has been very mild, he recently returned it a few days ago by asking for my number. We were flirting constantly, and finally went on a date last night. The date was amazing, we got food, laughed, held hands, and talked. We ended up sitting in my car for a while since it was cold out, and we were being quite physically affectionate. He went to kiss me on the lips, and I stopped him and said no. I told him that it was ok, he didn’t ruin the date, and even kissed him on the cheek. All of this on its own is fine, but when he asked me if I wanted a second date at the end… no, I didn’t. I don’t even know why I didn’t find him attractive anymore, but I just didn’t. I feel like I led him on or something and I feel horrible, I told him we could still be friends. Am I the buttface?

My dad’s aware, there was a case..but the case was closed due to lack of evidence.  My dad and I were talking, I’m not sure what, when he said it was normal for teenagers to hee their parents for no reason. I was confused and told him I think it was reasonable to hate my mom and not want to talk to her, he disagreed and we blew into an argument. He said it doesn’t matter my mom molested me, she’s still my mom and I should still talk to her. I feel like the butt face in this, maybe it wasn’t all that bad? Idk, AITBF?
118	adjudicated	YTB	I'm not looking for a serious relationship currently but still do enjoy going on dates. I am on Tinder and state that I'm only looking for something casual. I make it clear that I don't just mean sex and I would lie to go on dates etc but I'm not looking to be exclusively with one person and not looking to be in a relationship.  I get a good amount of matches so I have been enjoying going on dates with people. There has been one girl I started gonig on dates with that I get on well with. We've been bowling, to a few cocktail bars and on a day out etc. Again thoguh I made it clear to her from the start that it was only casual and that I will be goingo n dates with others.   After 5 or 6 dates over a few weeks, she starts talking about deleting Tinder. She said since we get on well she wants to be exclusive with me. I apologise but remind her that I'm not looking for a relationship and that I am still gonig on dates with other people. She sayd we could always give it a go but I again apologise and refuse.   She says I've clearly been leading her on sicne we've been going on actual dates together and that you don't go on days out with people you'er not seeing etc. I just remind her that she knows I don't want a relationship and if she wasn't okay with that then she should have said from the start.   One of my housemates is a woman so I ask for her opinion on it and she agreed with the girl and said I have been leading her on. The other housemates agree with me.  AITB for "leading a girl on"?
106	adjudicated	NTB	I (26F) have the same friend group since highschool and everything is going well we even have a groupchat on IG since most of moved far now. A couple of years ago, I noticed that we added a new person to the group who we will call Silvia (25F). I knew Silvia from highschool and she's a really cool person so at first I didn't mind, but as time has passed, she starting to sending alot of religious posts in the groupchat. Which I don't have a problem with religion but I just don't like it when someone shoves it in your face at every given chance. Everytime someone sends a random funny post to the chat, she'll have something bad to say because it goes against Christianity. Which to me, makes seems to make the chat less fun to be in now. I have expressed this her privately saying that I respect her beliefs and all but maybe minimize it in the groupchat since not everyone is Christian and all, but she still continues to do so. We've had made plans to hang out, but throughout the whole time we were all out, she kept trying to give us a Bible lesson whenever we did something "wrong" like have a drink and even told my friend she'll go hell for what she wore (literally a tanktop and some jeans). I try to avoid being around her because I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her and don't want her telling how to live me or my friends' lives. 
157	adjudicated	YTB	 For valentines day this year my partner and I said we wouldn't get each other presents and would just go out for a meal instead. We went for a day out of Saturday and my girlfriend saw an expensive box of chocolates that I could tell she really liked. They cost a lot more than we'd usually spend on chocolates.  She joked that she expected them for valentines day. I knew she was joking but could also tell that she liked them. I decided to order the chocolates as a surprise for her for valentines day. They arrived yesterday and I surprised her with them this morning. She looked shocked and then she seemed annoyed. She said I'd wasted too much money getting them and that I shouldn't have got them.  I told her not to worry about the money since it was my money anyway and I wanted to treat her. She just repeated that I shouldn't have got her them and walked away. I asked what her problem was and she just repeated that I shouldn't have gotten her them. I asked why since she clearly liked them and she just said I should have listened.

The mask was making it difficult to determine how they looked on my face so i took it off. (No one was even near me)  Well i got home and went to show my wife the pics and ask her advice as to which looked good. I showed her the first one and the first thing she said was "you took off your mask?" I explained why, and she stood up and walked across the room like i was carrying the plague. I left her room pissed because she's being ridiculous imo. As soon as i got out of her room she closed the door and isnt talking to me.  I did kind raise my voice and tell her it's been almost four years and that she cant fucking live in fear and treat me like im infected with illnesses Everytime i go out or dont wear a mask(i wear it always when i go out already even though i fucking hate it, though i have forgotten one a couple times by mistake).

170	adjudicated	NTB	I've been dating "Jane" for over a year and a half and her mom is in town this weekend.  She drove down yesterday (Friday) and my girlfriend originally said she planned on having all three of us go for "walks/meals" together.    When we were talking yesterday before her mom arrived, she mentioned that her mom is excited to watch the Superbowl (for the commercials) and she (Jane) hoped I would join them.  I told her I was planning to very intentionally not watch the game this year because I really dislike both teams and I don't watch football much anyway.    She seemed upset about that and said she still wants me to watch it with them, and I told her I would be happy to do other things throughout the day on Saturday or Sunday before the game.    So Saturday has almost come and gone and they spent a lot of the day at a pedestrian mall about a half mile from my house.  I wasn't invited to participate so I went to my normal morning workout then out to get Valentine's Day gifts for her and some lunch.  When I got back, I let her know I was in town and she said they were still shopping and about to get dinner.  I needed to run an errand nearby and mentioned that, but I wasn't asked to join for dinner or stop by to say hi- which is all fine by me, but it leads me to wonder....  If I decline to go to her house to watch the game tomorrow, WIBTB?  I'll talk to her tonight and let her know that's my plan and offer to go for a walk or a meal tomorrow, but I really don't want to sit around for 3-4 hours watching a game that I wish both teams could lose.    My concern is she will say I'm a jerk for not taking the opportunity to see her mom, but I think if that was an issue then should have made other plans for the 3 of us where I was included in the planning, which is a recurring issue for us because she often makes plans and then expects me to tag along without considering whether I want to or am even available.    Thanks for any feedback here!

162	adjudicated	NTB	My dog is my world. She is amazing and sweet and I care about her more than anything else.  I have recently been promoted and am adjusting to the hours, concerned that my dog would be neglected I asked around for someone to watch her. A (now ex) friend contacted me.  She is older and has two dogs and loves my dog. She said she would do it for free. I said I would bake or pay. She said no. I even slipped money into her purse and she found it and gave it back tied to my dog's collar.  Everytime she watched my dog, I would ask if she wanted payment. She said no. On the third day she sends me a message saying that her neighbor is helping her with the dogs and cannot feed her children, she would like me to pay $100 for the woman to get food. "It's what Jesus would do." She tells me and I just leave the money on the counter.  I didn't even bother thinking who this woman is. My dog is apparently spending her entire day with someone who cannot buy her kids food.  But anyway. I let it go. Everyday I get more messages: give me money to take her out to lunch, she is hungry, I don't want her to think I am abusing the friendship.  I recently told her I am uncomfortable with this arrangement because of the begging and lack of transparency. I have tried giving her money and I have offered everytime. She says no. Yesterday she says she's getting over her pride to ask for money and I told her I have been offering but she declines. She vehemently lies and I show the text message which ends up in a phone call that ends up in voicemail that I promptly delete.  I know she's screaming at me.  I contact the neighbor via Facebook and tell her about being a "charity case" she said she has enough money to feed her kids and that of the $100 she only received $40. I sent her the screenshots and she said I was overreacting.  There is a screenshot that literally says: "she has no money to feed her kids, please give me $100 to help."  I end up blocking them both but in the end, am I the asshole in this situation?
354	adjudicated	EAB	*This is purely fictional.  I am not married (or even dating anybody at the moment), and I do not have kids.  I plan to become a parent someday, but not right now.*  &amp;#x200B;  My husband, who we'll call Frank, feels very strongly about not disappointing our kids regarding promises he makes to them.  This is because his parents frequently broke promises, moved goalposts after making a deal, reneged on promised rewards for the tiniest misbehavior.  He's overcompensating for his childhood.  I, on the other hand, was raised with parents who generally kept their word.  But I was also raised to understand that essential stuff came first, and if the choices were essential errand or bill vs. promised activity or treat, then the promise had to be broken.  On to what sparked this particular conflict.  Frank needed to do the grocery shopping this afternoon because I had to work late, and he had promised our 7 year old son, who we'll call Marvin, that he'd take him to the trampoline park this afternoon.  Frank realized he didn't have time to do both, so he picked the promised fun but not necessary thing over the essential grocery shopping.  When I got home, I saw that the groceries had not been bought.  I asked him about it, and when he explained, I just snapped.  "Sometimes you have to disappoint your kids, okay!  They need to learn that sometimes, things don't work out!  Now I have to get groceries because you can't get your priorities straight!"  I had to buy the groceries because he didn't want to disappoint Marvin.  He argued back "They can learn that things don't always work out without us breaking our promises!"  We argued back and forth for quite a while.  &amp;#x200B;  Was my husband really in the right to not do the essential grocery shopping to keep a promise?  Or am I in the right for saying that sometimes, you have to disappoint your kid?  Reddit, who is the jerk in this situation?
430	adjudicated	NTB	 AITBF for yelling at my dad because he wants to attend a family gathering? My dad has been lonely since my mothers death that happened several years ago. He has no job and no friends since he quit and is living of his retirement funds. Recently my male cousin, lets call him John, invited all family members for a huge family gathering at his house. This is an annual thing that I have atteneded many times before.   The relationship between John and my dad is that when my mother died he was quick to offer and help us with funeral arrangements when we were distraught and confused. So my dad respects John a lot for this. I also respected and am greatful towards him. But my feelings towards him changed when I heard from my uncles that they went to his house and John and his wife got into an argument where he punched his wife in front of them and continued to beat her up. My uncles stopped him and John got out a sickle knife and started threatening that he would hurt them if they tried to fight him. Eventually he calmed down and the ending is not so clear but my uncles went home in fear that John would kill them. This was not reported to the police because John's mother begged them not to. John's three children were there in the house when this went down. His wife is alive. It was later revealed that he has been beating his wife up for years and that he has several mistresses and flaunted the fact that he has been sleeping around to his wife.  My dad knows all of the above info but still wants to go to the party and bring me along. I said NO! And I remineded him of the horrific stuff John has done to his wife and the threat to harm/kill my uncles. My dad just said that that is a matter between husband and wife and has nothing to do with coming together to a family gathering. Stuff he said to me on this: 'Do you want me to be lonely? Why am are you banning me from gathering with my other blood relatives? Why are you 'fighting' with me on this? All your other uncles and aunts who know about the abuse situation are also coming, in fact, they were the ones who asked if I will come. Am I to spend my life alone?' etc.   I told him right back: 'You're supporting abuse by going. How can you eat and drink and have fun in his house, around his wife when you know about the terrible things she was put through by John? If there is a heaven you won't be going to it! So much for morals, it is becoming clearer and clearer who you truly are.'  I told him he can go if he wants to go but I sure as hell will not!  So AITBF?
355	adjudicated	YTB	My fiance (M29) and I (M21) had recently gone to a birthday dinner type of thing for my older brother, El (M24). For context, My brother and i grew up in a crappy council house, basically lived in poverty, we were both kicked out of high school at fifteen and sixteen. We had to sort ourselves out, and we did a bunch of stuff which no one can really be proud of.  El's mates were there too, we had grown up together and we were talking about the stuff we did as teenagers. At one point, we talked about all the ways we tried to get money, about living in each other's houses and having nowt to eat in the house, so we made toast with bread that was going green and got the most awful food poisoning. This wasn't a pity party though, we weren't going round sharing our woes, we were laughing about it. We had it horrible growing up but we did our best to make it seem a laugh. Plus, we did have fun, it wasn't all doom and gloom.  After we got in the car to leave, Damon (my fiance), seemed bothered by it all. He grew up pretty standard middle class. He asked if I was okay, and started talking all about childhood trauma etc etc. I told him that it was fine, he doesn't have to pity me for being poor. He then started to lecture me, about how there's nothing funny about poverty and that by making a joke of it, we were minimizing the struggles. Said that we were 'masking' trauma by laughing about it. Just kept going on about this.  I told him that he just won't ever understand what it was like, because he's middle class. He went to a grammar school, he works in finance now - we are just on complete different ends of the spectrum. He's been upset about it recently, ignoring me and saying that i dont seem to view him as an equal purely because he has money.

More recently I've had the door closed to focus on work and my gf will knock on the door, say hi and just wait there for me to respond or will come to the door and just start talking.

313	adjudicated	YTB	 I’ve had a long stretch of mental issues post pandemic. I went to sixth form directly after for 2 years, and the whole time it was horrible, I skipped massive chunks of it and stayed to myself the whole time. Looking back I was to egoistic to even make an effort to make new friends and had to watch any old friends make new friends and memories. I was optimistic to start university in September 22 but didn’t I deferred my place without telling my parents and sat on my ass at home. I continuesly lied to them about starting later, all while having a huge depressive episode about having no friends and being lonely and scared to start.  During 2023 I got in contact with some people but ended up ignoring them again because I liked using them as a safety blanket without actually talking to them. And I made a shitload of posts on this sub about whenever my mum mentioned a bit of socialisation or having friends and taking it on as an attack. Not A lot but ALL  of you told me that I’m in the wrong and I seriously wished I listened. I lied about going to therapy then to people who commented on my post because for some strange reason I wanted to deeply know if my mum was stopping me progressing when I know for a fact she’s been supporting me all her life and even in those hard times last year and now.   However I’ve started therapy in November end and it’s been great. I wish the sessions were longer. I’ve stopped winging at small things and I see the change of how I think in some ways. I can leave the house without my mum 90% of the time to the point I find it abnormal to stay at home the whole day.   Now it’s January and the hard hitting truth of my lack of enjoyment after the pandemic (and it being  50% of my childhood missing due to anxiety shyness), I feel horrible I feel that I should’ve started University last September at the very least. I know many peers that did a 1 year late start. My parents are still very persistent and I can see their frustration about me not going to have a a job or the financial side of things. I have this really strong thought or feeling that my mum is to blame for me not starting last term but I’m trying my best to not go into that rabbit hole.

I've wanted to become a man for a while, so a teenage boy (15M) offered to sell me pubes for $10. I bought them with my hard-earned cash, only to find out from my dumbass friends that I was scammed and that you actually have to wait for pubic hair to grow on you. To make matters worse, when I tried to get this asshole to refund me, he took the rest of my money and burned it all.  Long story short, I finally managed to get back at him. I tricked him into believing that I was going to get a local pony to bite off his weiner at a chili cookoff I organized, so that he would send his parents to "rescue" said pony. The pony's owner is a crazy redneck, so I informed him that violent pony killers were in the area. Assuming the teen's parents were the violent pony killers I told him about, he shot and killed them when he saw them on his property.  As the redneck was giving his report, I was able to steal the bodies and use a hacksaw to make chili out of their flesh. The teenager, not realizing his parents were dead, happily ate the chili I cooked for him, only for me to reveal the truth to him afterwards. Not only did I trick him into eating his own parents and make him cry, but I even humiliated him in front of his favorite band!  But now everyone is scared of me and my mom has grounded me for a week. AITB for teaching a con artist a lesson?

Male 20, have been close since childhood. Recently he got a girlfriend and I was extremely happy for him as he'd been single for years. Their relationship seemed adorable, him always messaging me and raving about her, which was very sweet to me. Now, recently they moved in together and every time I called she picked up the phone, which I didn't really mind. I said hi and sometimes we even talked for a while. But recently when I called she just blew up saying.. Why had I been calling so much, why was I so obsessed with her boyfriend ETC ETC and told me to leave them alone and stop trying to get in between them. Passed the phone to him and he agreed. I decided to not push it as I am unconfrontational. Now he had been spamming me and apologizing saying he'd dump her for me if I asked him.. And called me crying.

My friend (18F), who we will call Nikki, and I (18M) created a group of each of our close friends, which ended up being around 10 people of 4 guys and 6 girls. With this group, we spent basically every day together during our junior year summer  &amp;#x200B;  However, during the school year, I started to feel distant from the group. I originally chalked it up to clubs/school work, and would sometimes be gone for tournaments.  &amp;#x200B;  After 2 months of this, I started to realize that even when I was able to hang out with them, it felt very odd. They would whisper to each other when I was around, they would give a judging remark to anything that I said, and would overall kind of ignore me and these other two girls that were closer to me, who will go by Rachel and Stella (Both 18f).  &amp;#x200B;  5 months later and a year from today, it all came to a head right before our school's winter ball, which I thought we would go to as a group. However, a week before the dance, Nikki texts our group chat accusing of me, Rachel, and Stella of planning a sleepover for the night of the dance without them. I shot this down, because none of us had even discussed anything.  &amp;#x200B;  This brought hours of argument, which ended when they 180'ed the conversation. They began to say that it wasn't about the sleepover, and were just distancing for differing reasons. Most of their complaints were that they didn't really feel like they understood my humor and how it was different, but one stood out. One of the guys, Max (18m), expressed that he was uncomfortable with the bro-mantic/gay jokes, which was a problem because I was bi.  &amp;#x200B;  With everyone telling me all of that, they stopped talking in the group chat. We stopped talking in person. This hurt me. I even cried for the first time in a while. I wasn't sad about them cutting me off, but about how they didn't try to repair the friendship. It took me months and going to college to make new friends, and even more for my trust issues to come back. To this day, I still overthink once in a while and it has made me more closed off than I was before.  &amp;#x200B;  Back to now, I have a new group and in college, with the old group going to the same college. Nikki and another girl in the old group, will be named Sara (18f), have come up to me many times and tried to make conversation, which always end up being small talk. I absolutely hated this, and wished to be basically left alone.  &amp;#x200B;  One day, when Sara texts me asking to catch up. Pent up due to them essentially pretending as if we were still friends, I sent her a angry paragraph to her explaining that I did not want to talk and how I was hurt by what had happened in the past. She passively aggressively texts back that she had never took a part in kicking me out, and that she just wanted to check up on me.  &amp;#x200B;  Now none of them talk to me, which I think it is good. However, I think I may have been too mean and she could also be right in the way that she was never involved. AITB?
191	adjudicated	NTB	This is going to sound petty and I agree that it is. My girlfriend likes to play board games and games together on the nintendo switch. Most of these game are just luck anyway with no skill needed but some of them you actually need skill.     I've been playing games a lot longer than my girlfriend so I am better at a lot of them. This means I win a lot of the time. Not all of the time  thoguh and there are still times my gf wins. The issue is she's starting to get annoyed whenever I win. I've tried talking to her about playing different games, maybe not playing at all if that's the reaction she has etc but she refuses.      She said it's shit watching me win all the time and that I could always let her win at times. I mention that she's not a child and me letting her win would be obvious so wouldn't really change anything. I also point out a lot of the games are just luck anyway so I can't really do anything with that.      She just repeated that it's shit for her to keep losing so I just repeated the suggestion of finding new games or just stopping playing but she said she doesn't want to. She said I should just want to enjoy playing the game with her and should be fine letting her win but I pointed out the same logic could be applied to her in that she should just be fine playing the game with me and be fine with me winning but she said it wasn't the same.      AITB for not letting my girlfriend win when we play games?
439	adjudicated	NTB	For a long time I (F27) figured I was safe from having to post in this sub because I have a half decent family, but today I guess they decided to prove me wrong.  Because of various health issues I've had two bouts of telogen effluvium (hair shed) since last January and will likely be having another one in the next couple months.  I have severe anxiety and depression on a good day and this whole debacle has had me spending the last 11 months as what professionals refer to as a "basket case". And, as many of you probably know, stress and hair growth do not go hand-in-hand. Because of the severe stress my hair has caused me, along with the likelihood that it will begin shedding again soon, I've decided to cut it and get a wig.  My few family members (mom, grandma, and uncle) who know about my hair loss were reluctant to support this because, as of now, the loss isn't terribly noticeable. However, for me this texture and general anxiety over it is more important at this point.  At this point I've cut my hair into a rough pixie cut and have been wearing a wig out in public. I plan to shave my head soon as seeing it is still triggering, and I believe I have the best chance at recovery if I get it out of my sight.  However, for Christmas dinner with my family today I decided to go without it because I knew I would likely be tired by the evening and want to lay down on the couch.  When I arrived my grandmother and uncle complimented my hair but were still somewhat supportive of my plan.  However, when my aunt arrived and commented on my hair, my grandmother remarked "We like it more than wigs" and proceeded to explain the situation to my aunt and talk about how I have "Always had such beautiful hair". Immediately my face went red and I said "Thanks, grandma", to which she replied that it "wasn't a big deal" because my aunt is family.  My face was red for several minutes and I was mostly silent for the next couple hours. My mother assumed I was angry with my aunt and seemed surprised when I told her it was my grandmother I was angry at. (My mother has also told a family member about my hair loss without my permission, but apologized when I told her it upset me.)  My mother said I shouldn't be so angry with my grandmother because other people don't understand that I don't want the subject talked about, and that I need to explain it to them myself so that they don't. This angered me more and I said I didn't want to speak about it anymore.  Once my aunt left I told my grandmother not to talk about it to other people. She hugged me and said "Okay", explaining that she just doesn't see the loss.(I also texted my aunt apologizing for being standoffish and letting her know I was angry with my grandmother, not her)  When leaving my mother mentioned the evening had been nice even with "Grandma's faux pas", and repeated what she said earlier.  AITB for being too sensitive?
454	adjudicated	NTB	I (19M) live with my two parents, my older brother and a younger sister. We typically get along well, but we all have our flaws. I am extremely germophobic and stubborn, which really manifested tonight. You see, about two days ago, my younger sister got sick with COVID and I took the initiative to quarantine to avoid catching it. I've been washing my hands constantly, wearing a mask when in contact with others and sanitizing every surface I touch. Obviously, tonight is Christmas Eve and the family was all gathered around, including my sister with COVID. They all handled the food, and when they called me down to eat, I went down and saw my sister sitting down with everybody, handling the food. I told them that I appreciated the meal they had made, but that I wasn't going to eat anything handled by them because I didn't want to get sick and that I'd drive myself up and get something instead. They all got mad, saying that it was very insensitive of me to not get together with the family. I tried telling them that I was just looking out for myself, but maybe I was a bit harsh by declining to sit with them. AITA?
123	adjudicated	NTB	I just found out my wife had an affair with a coworker, our lives are devastated. Initially she was defensive and withholding most of what took place, I kept at it and eventually discovered much more, including that the two had even discussed and corroborated their stories after deciding to end it, limiting it to one brief drunken kiss in a bar with some texting and emotional connection. In reality it was an ongoing physical &amp; emotional affair spanning multiple weeks &amp; cities.  My wife claims she intended to tell me, while the reason it came out is because I'd been suspicious &amp; discovered their secret chats, confronting her first. There's no way of knowing how it would have gone otherwise. When I confronted her, she gaslit me, scapegoated me, lied and performed all the manipulative-tactics and mental-gymnastics. I understand she was hurting and scared, eventually she did come "clean" about more after about 36 hours of my persistence.  I spoke with the male; a mutual coworker with whom we have long history, his wife included. He attempted to assess my knowledge of the situation and censored his story even more-so than my wife, leaving out all physical. I said to him "I hope you do right by your wife" to which he replied arrogantly that: "I may have to answer some questions".  I hadn't been able to sleep for days, was alone and in crisis. I ended up contacting his wife to talk about it, before he brought it up. Immediately I felt like it was wrong, but it was too late. As I broke the news to her I felt guilty and expressed to his wife that I felt terrible, like I was betraying my wife, how ironic.  Subsequently, I worried I may have put myself and my wife in danger. I texted her and told her what I'd done and that I felt awful. She responded and is very upset, claiming I "did not give them the opportunity to see if he would be honest" (while I think that's exactly what I did, because she knows the truth and plans to wait to see what he says), and overall my wife is defending him and using this against me. My wife says it could've been discussed, which I don't disagree with, however I did bring it up to her multiple times prior, and she insisted I do not tell to "protect our reputation."  Now I'm the bad-guy. She's concerned his wife will blame her and want to see her suffer, and that she'll "spread shit about" her, and in her words "not that I care". But I do. To his wife I communicated that I'd be committed to keeping this between the four of us, and that I intend to try to work things out with my wife through counseling. I am so broken right now I can't think straight and feel like I have no one to talk because I am trying to protect my wife's reputation and that of our marriage. I felt like I was just championing the truth. AITB for telling my co-worker's wife that my wife and her husband had an affair?
54	adjudicated	NTB	Hey everyone. Yesterday, I posted this thread in AITA before it was removed because it mentioned violence. When I posted this thread yesterday, I was just feeling sad. But now, I'm angry. I can't help but feel angry at everyone and everything, including my little sister. I've copied-and-pasted my post in AITA here:  "I (m30) have an 18-year-old sister named Angela. For the first 10-ish years of her life, Angela was a normal happy girl, and our family was normal. After her 10th birthday, our father turned into a monster towards her. Our mother did not actively hurt my sister, but mom did nothin to keep her safe. I was in the Navy while my little sister was going through hell at home, and I was oblivious to everything. I mean, sometimes I would visit my family, and my sister was no longer the cheerful little girl that I knew, but I just thought it was typical teenage angst.  My sister told me, only relatively recently, why exactly she was so moody and downcast throughout the past several years. I was stunned, and I helped her run away and she lived with our aunt and uncle (who are awesome and they have reigned hell on our parents) until she moved away for college.  My sister and lost her temper at me last month. She regularly has mood swings, and she would alternate between being kind and compassionate towards me, and being so angry. Anyway, last month, she told me that she hates me and that she blames me for not rescuing her earlier. She said the most awful stuff during our argument. And I didn’t argue back at her. What could I say to someone who has been through what she’s been through? She did apologize to me in the evening, and all I could do was apologize to her.  A few days afterwards, Angela visited my wife and I. I sat down with my sister, and I really urged her to go to therapy (I don’t know if her college’s health and wellness center would suffice but she does have access to that) and figure out how to let go of her anger. I motioned with my hand, and I turned my hand into a tight fist and just released it, telling her to let go like that. I regret saying this, because my sister started crying, and she just screamed that she wants to die. I initially tried talking soothingly with her, but she was so loud and panicky that I got angry with her (I couldn't help but get angry at her), and I told her “you can’t fucking live like this”. She makes me want to cry."  None of us can really help our emotions. With that being said, AITB for being viscerally angry at my little sister? Rather than being, you know, sad for her? Is this normal?
337	adjudicated	INFO	My bf recently moved states for work and is in town visiting me. He’s been staying in a hotel because his family dynamic isn’t good and he doesn’t want to stay with them.  I live with my family, otherwise I would offer him to stay with me.   On his first day back to visit, we were hanging out and then he dropped me home around midnight. He was contemplating where to stay for the night and was parked outside my house while trying to figure it out. He was debating staying in his car overnight atp. I let him know that if he sleeps in his car, he cannot stay parked outside my house all night bc my dad would think it’s very odd to see him there when he leaves for work early in the morning.  He understood and I went to sleep. I randomly woke up at 2 am and saw him still outside. I tried calling him but he didn’t answer, so I went out there to find him asleep in his car. I had to knock on the window to wake him up and ask him why he was still there. He said he accidentally fell asleep. I told him he needed to go. He got upset and started asking if I was hiding something. He questioned if I had gone out during those two hours of him sleeping. I said no and he eventually left.  A couple days later he visited me during my lunch break at work. He was working remote that day and was doing meetings at the library before seeing me. However after dropping me at work, he went and bought some food and came back to the parking lot of my work. He didn’t tell me he was coming back but I saw him pulling in. I went outside to ask what he was doing and he said he was just going to eat lunch/work there bc he didn’t know where else to go and wanted to be close to a bathroom.   I told him I felt like he was spying on me and he said no and it was weird that I would assume that and that me saying that makes him feel like I’m hiding something. I asked him to please leave and he said no bc he had a right to be in that parking lot. He said I should appreciate that he wants to be close to me and should be more considerate that he can’t stay with his family while trying to visit me.  AITBF for not being more considerate to his situation and assuming he was spying on me?
39	adjudicated	NTB	Recently my daughter (7 yo, in 2nd grade) came home from school and told us "I think I'm in trouble, Jane (her classmate) said she was going to bring a \[pew-pew\] to school tomorrow and \[injure\] me." She did say she had told her teacher when it happened which surprised me because it was already after 5pm and I had not heard anything from the school.   By 8pm I had still heard nothing so I reached out to the principal and the teacher asking what was going on and how they would be handling the situation. Later that evening I got a reply from the principal stating that they were aware of the situation and assured me they were taking it seriously and were confident Jane knew comments like that aren’t okay, but they could not share any disciplinary actions taken against another student.  The next morning, I let my daughter know that the principal had spoken with Jane. I incorrectly assumed that Jane would be suspended for the day and sent my daughter off to school  Less than a week later when the class had a field trip, they put my daughter and Jane in the same car. I had not heard anything else from the school during that week, so I followed up with the principal and teacher about the trip, asking why they would put the girls together after what had just happened, again asking for clarification about the school's policies for an incident like this and also why I had to be the one to reach out to them after hearing about the incident from my daughter.  The principal's reply was that she did not feel my daughter was in danger to return to school, but agreed she should have let me know. She again reiterated that she couldn't share specifics but was confident Jane knows those comments are inappropriate.   I pushed back again asking to understand what a typical response would be for what had occurred and the vice principal said they “talk to the student about it”. When I asked why a student saying something like this wouldn't be suspended for a day, she said they felt the school was the best place to deal with issues and if they only sent the student home there is no way to know if/how the parents would address it. I asked why they couldn’t do both but have not yet gotten a reply.   At no point did I ever believe Jane actually had the access or desire to follow through. But we live in the US where this is sadly far too common and I think this specific claim warrants a heightened response to help Jane understand just how inappropriate it is.   At this age kids say lots of dumb things that are just them being kids, but to another child feel very real. Ensuring that my daughter had a chance to be reassured that school is a safe place and she wasn’t in danger I think is incredibly important and would have been more easily accomplished had Jane been suspended for a day.  AITB for continuing to push back with the school and having expected them to suspend a 2nd grader for one day?
290	adjudicated	JB	I am F 25 from India.Also pretty emotional as this just happened so please bear if the info is all over the place.  For a little background, I am the oldest child &amp; have a brother(21).Since childhood mistakes were rewarded with beatings which is a common thing in our family and friend circle but not in every household, I learned later.I remember that I had sworn to protect my brother from the beatings which never happened.Since I was kid I had noticed favourtism towards my brother.I was close to my mom initially but all changed once I went to college &amp; started favouring my brother.We both faced the controlling aspects of our parents especially with regards to privacy. As kids our mom would tell us about maritial problems and bitch about my paternal family(they didn't treat my mom well) which made me resent them and my father.As we both grew we understood that our mom is emotional &amp; manipulative &amp; our father is practical.My mom never got the opportunity to study &amp; work so takes out the jealousy in form of anger and taunts towards me imo. I love you or sorry is not used in the house.My brother is privy to everything going on in family &amp; my life but not me.Anything that goes wrong in my brother life is somehow my fault &amp; get  berated for it.Theres a lot of hurt but it will never change.   Now today's situation, we moved to a new house &amp; in process of getting unpacked &amp; organised.I have a cat for past 2 years, my parents hate cats (lost their 1st child during childbirth due to infection from cat saliva).They asked me to leave my toxic job it was severely affecting my mental &amp; physical health &amp; they asked for 5 months to do so and move in with them they knew it would be with my cat.I was not aware of the reason of the hatred of cats until a year back but manage it well and try to keep both my parents and cat happy.At night Mom and I were moving heavy comforter from my room to another in the process my cat again got scared &amp; hissed &amp; tried to nip at my dad's leg.Cat doesn't bite hard to puncture skin she does toshow she is scared.He thought my cat is attacking him, he shouted &amp; then threw a shoe to hit her.Seeing this I immediately tried to run towards my cat my mom was in front &amp; in that frantic situation I tried move her to the side but she fell &amp; I tried to catch her &amp; I am sorry she got hurt.she said I pushed her.she has the tendency of dramatising things &amp; she does have balance problems, she is overweight.I ran towards my cat to check on her.I lost my cool as she could have been seriously hurt and started shouting at my dad.I told him to say sorry.He said to not ask stupid things &amp; just gave angry looks.Now I am in my room &amp; I refuse to interact with them until they apologise to me and my cat.  AITA how I reacted? I know they won't say sorry &amp; would just act normal tomorrow which happens after every fight.
315	adjudicated	YTB	For a little context I'm in a relationship right now, Hes my same age and we go to the same school, but my mum keeps accusing me of "showing myself off" to him, for reasons i really dont understand because i've never and will never do things like that, no hate to anyone that does, but anyway.  Me: "I wasn't naked again, and I dont do that I can show you my call logs again"  Mum: "Still you shouldnt be basically naked in your room, you need to be ready for people to come in"  Me: "I was ready for someone in my own family to come in, like if it was just charlie i could've thrown on a shirt while she was in my room because shes my sister"   Mum: "If you want to continue this come upstairs to talk to me."  Sooo i did and when i got upstairs i sat infront of my mum but she ignored me and didnt say anything so i started the conversation off with:  Me: "I should be able to wear what i want in my room"  Mum: "You need to be modest at all times, you have siblings that want to come in your room, and your dad"   Me: "They should knock, It wouldve taken me 10 seconds to throw on a shirt, it's not like I was butt naked, plus its my room?"  Mum: "I pay for this house, that room is mine your rooms about to be the downstairs lounge in a minute if you dont stop being disrespectful, then you'll have no privacy at all!"  Me: "I feel like my room is my safe space, a place i dont have to be anything for anyone, I dont want to have to change that because of you wanting me to be modest at all times, you walk around in your garments and you're almost never decent in your room either?"  Mum: "When have i ever done that?"  Me: "a bunch of t-"  Mum: \*cuts me off\* "There goes your victim complex again, I'm just your punching bag huh?"   At this point I was super over whealmed so i got up to leave for a little to cool down then come back but it didnt go well  Me: "I need to cool off, I'll be back"  Mum: "Leave your phone here"  Me: "Why?"  Mum: "So you cant go whining to your friends about how horrible your mother is"   Me: "You do the same thing about me to dad? I hear you griping about me a lot"  Mum: "You make me look bad to your friends, and make them hate me"  Me: "I don't choose how they feel about you, I just tell them about how I feel about you after things happen"   Mum: "Oh because you hate me soooo much"  Me: "Sometimes I do get to that point, and i tell them that I hate you sometimes, but you do the same"  I walked away at that point and she was still shouting at me but i was ignoring her, later she came and took my phone away while i was on the phone with my best friend talking about what happened. Was I the buttface for THIS.
116	adjudicated	NTB	I am at university currently and I am actively using dating apps. I'm not looking for anything serious which I make clear from the start and just want to date really. There was one person I went on a date with a month ago.  The date was going well, we went for drinks and then when she goes to the toilet her friend comes over and tells me not to hurt her and that I better treat her right etc. I told her friend it was a first date and I found it weird she was sat watching us tbh.  After drinks the girl suggests I go back to hers but at this point she has been really intense and talking about relationships and things so I tell her I've had a good time but that I think we're looking for different things.  Last weekend I was on a date with someone else and the date was gonig great. Then the other girl walks in and once my date goes to the toilet she comes over asking what was so wrong with her and that I clearly was just using her etc and don't actually like her. I politely ask her to leave me alone and she just keeps gonig on so I ask the bar staff to get security and say she;s harassing me so security make her leave.  I was telling a friend the story and he said that I could have been nicer to her and that getting her kicked out was a bit far but I don't see how it was when she wouldn't leave me alone.  AITB for getting a woman kicked out of the bar?  Edit for clarity: the girl who approached me on the second date was the girl I went on the first date with, not her friend
242	adjudicated	NTB	(With big update) AITBF for blowing up at my sister when she asked me for help yet again.  So my sister(24) who is younger by a year and a half, will only ever talk to me when she needs help or needs something. Ie she calls when she needs money, help moving, my credit card, using my parking, booking things, ect. So last week, and my sister called me to ask to borrow my credit card. She was at a hotel in another city and the hotel wouldn’t give her the room, even though she paid for it because she only has a prepaid card, they need a credit card on file. I blew up at her that she only ever talks to me when she needs something and can’t even be bothered to ask me how I’m doing even once in the past two years. And then I brought up the fact that she forgot to even wish me a happy birthday this year even though I knew she knew it was my birthday( I made a snap about my birthday and she had seen it). And I also mentioned that when it was her birthday this year that I had wished her a happy birthday and she didn’t even reply( her birthday is after mine). She called our mom to complain about me not wanting to help and my mom called me mad that I didn’t help my sister out “because she’s your sister and you always help out family”. This wasn’t out of the norm. Our mom always takes my sisters side with anything and everything.  So. Am I the Buttface?  Big update   So my mom and my sister have decided that this was the hill they were gonna die on. My mom has stopped me from seeing my brother and so because of that I went to a lawyer to see what I could do. My dad is also upset with my mom and has had enough of her so he is divorcing her. My sister has started an online campaign against me saying I’m a terrible person and how I refuse to help her and all that saying I’m splitting up the family. My dad is gonna help me fight to get guardianship for my brother (he’s disabled and can never work) over my mother cuz she’s unstable and has had multiple mental breakdowns.  I’m upset with how everything turned out. But I figure that if I just let them talk their bs and do their little circus that people will realize what I’ve been dealing with.  I’m not sure if I’ll update again but we will see. 
164	adjudicated	NTB	I don't think I'm doing anything wrong here but my boyfriend thinks I am. In the last 5 years I have lost my father, 2 brothers, a sister and 2 uncles. I am now the only living child my mum has and she has no living siblings so we're close. We live in different cities so don't get to see each other too often, maybe once every 2 months for a day.   This means I'll call her each day to check in and see how she is since she cannot text. I'll give quick 5 min calls on my way to and from work and when I'm on my own for example if I'm home alone or if I'm walknig ot the shops. My boyfriend knows I do this and it does not interefere with our time together.  He sat me down last night to say he finds it weird how much I talk to my mum and thinks I should heavily cut down. I asked why he thoguht that and he just said it was far too excessive and I shouldn't be talking to her that much.   I disagreed with him and refused to cut down how much I talk to her. He said I was disregarding his feelings and not listening to him. I just said that listennig to him does not mean doing whatever he asks. I pointed out me talking to my mum does not affect him in the slightest and he just repeated that it was weird and excessive and I should listen to him.  AITB for talking to my mum?
386	adjudicated	INFO	 We’re both 20.  She told me that in sophomore year of her hs (so 15?) there was a guy who took interest in her while in a relationship. She claims she never flirted with him or reciprocated his flirting (she said she used to say she was "fine" and cute and stuff) but she used to hug him all the time because she thought he was cute. He also texted her on “Snapchat” and he would flirt with her, but sometimes randomly she would ask him “how’s your gf”. Like would visit him and her friend in his hr and hug him and talk to him. Then she called him out for saying she was a second choice and he stopped the flirting or whatever.  Two years later in her senior year, after he was already broken up with his other gf he asks her on a date and she goes. She also claims she was uncomfortable during it and like a few weeks later called him out for trying to cheat on his gf back in her sophomore year and then cut him off because she "came to her senses" after allowing him back into her life.   She has OCD and has been thinking about this for awhile now and tells me she feels like a terrible irredeemable person. I know she feels bad, but I feel like this is a red flag almost. Like she doesn’t respect boundaries almost and might cheat on the future if she condoned it…She’s upset and sad that I’m upset with her for her own actions  AITBF?

Also, given my friend has PTSD and I posted in the PTSD forum, I'm not sure if the responses will be a bit biased in her favour. Would really appreciate more responses.

153	adjudicated	NTB	My boyfriend (27M) and I (25F) have been together for 5 years. He is a lawyer and i am studying/training to be a psychologist.  I am someone who loves giving and receiving gifts, and my boyfriend is aware of this.  This year for Valentine's Day, I gave my boyfriend a kurta (traditional Indian ethnic wear) that I thought he might like to wear for a local festival that was also incidentally on the 14th of February.  I had spent some time looking for a design that I thought he'd like, and I was very excited to give it to him. On receiving the gift, his response was, "It's nice, but I have nicer kurtas. His reaction bummed me out somewhat but I shrugged it off then.  My boyfriend's gift to me was a small potted plant and a pack of 4 Ferrero Rochers. The plant was in a small mud-crusted pot with dirt all over it.  Now, i love both plants and chocolates. But I do not usually keep plants at home because i cannot take proper care of them.  So this particular gift felt very impersonal and last minute to me, and I couldn't help feeling disappointed.  In fact, I felt a little insulted because i knew that he could easily afford a more personalized gift, but he simply chose not to. Even the chocolates he gave were the smallest pack available in the market and i usually buy myself bigger boxes of the same.  I know it probably sounds materialistic, and i am grateful for the gifts i received, but i also feel sligh resentful that he thought I'm only worth so much to him.
437	adjudicated	NTB	For some backstory My (18f) male friend (19m) was born very premature AND have his read receipts on for texting    So one day my friend faced timed me and he usually never does without any context so I message him asking if he’s ok and he replies with “Currently at doctor getting hormone IV” I got concerned and start messaging him making sure he’s ok even though it’s not my job, he says he’s fine and we chat and eventually says that he has to go and I don’t text him until Friday (he had the app. on Wednesday)   I ask him if he’s ok and replies by saying “I will survive” 3 hours later. then I start panicking because I didn’t realize he had a high chance of mortality and then dosent text. I start thinking that he died but I don’t wanna spam text him so I text him once, then another and finally reads it and says “it’s a joke” I get mad telling him “you know you can die from that shit from hormone imbalance right? Don’t fucking scare me like that” it’s now Tuesday and I’m starting to feel bad because I may have been genuinely overreacting so, AITBF
252	adjudicated	YTB	So. 👏. I need some opinions. I am uninterested in going overseas. And the general opinion is. I just dislike going overseas. It's not a complete hatred of going out. But more rather a pure disinterest. From the earliest moments I got my Passport, I went to Johor Bahru. FYI. I live in Singapore. Where it is either hot or cold depending on the seasons, there is no winter, but there is plenty of rain and strong winds. And I'm content to live in my Little Red Dot on the map of the world. And while it was nice to explore, the mood slowly dies as for a good chunk of my current years being in my 20s, I've been struggling with my mental health, possibly Adhedonia and Depression. That and I'm an Introvert with Asperger Syndrome. My Mother recently has been planning to go to Thailand this year as part of CNY [Chinese New Year], while I stay here in SG. And from the moment i stated my disinterest, I only said 'What's the Point?' My mom got unhappy and annoyed. And it's almost the regular behavior I deal with everyday during the evenings. Now TBF. Thailand is far. And while it would be bad to miss such an opportunity of a lifetime, I am happier at home, than to be outside in an alien environment I am unfamiliar with. So AITBF?  Edit: Okay. I'll admit. I am more than just an 🫏 for being completely negative towards my mother. I get it. I could be called the 👹, and That would be reasonable. I'm taking my Ls and learning from this. So yes. AITBF? No. But AITA? Yes. Good Jury. Imma head out.
81	adjudicated	NTB	I(19) met my friend M(19) in 2023 online, and while we got along, there were some issues that arose over time. M seemed more invested in the friendship than I was, often unwilling to compromise and frequently venting about their struggles, which became overwhelming for me. Despite my own mental health challenges, I supported them as best I could, but it became draining when every conversation revolved around their problems.  Despite my discomfort, I tried to maintain the friendship until my own mental health took a nosedive due to unrelated events. Upon reflection, I realized how much stress M's constant complaints were causing me, so I decided to end the friendship. Instead of abruptly cutting ties, I sent a letter explaining my reasons and wished them well in finding someone better suited to their needs.  It's important to note that only one week has passed since I sent the letter.  Furthermore, I attempted to open up about my own issues, but M always seemed uncomfortable or sad and needed to end the conversation, which made me feel like I was oversharing, even though they regularly shared much more intimate details of their life.  Additionally, M would message me at least three times a day for no particular reason, often questioning my actions or whereabouts, such as if I mentioned I was in bed.  Despite my efforts to address the situation, I had brought up many times that they seemed to only complain and didn't seem to be making any actual changes to help things get better. However, every time I did, they just dismissed my concerns, claiming I was being mean or didn't understand.  While I unfriended them on social media, I didn't block their number. Initially, they responded positively, mentioning they would seek help for their mental health struggles, but recently, they reached out, questioning why I gave up on them. They argued that they were worth being friends with because of their kindness and support for others, trying to persuade me to reconsider.  Despite their pleas, I'm not entirely sure about my decision, as I do value the friendship we had, but I believe it was necessary for my well-being. So, Reddit, AITB for ending the friendship because it was detrimental to my mental health?  TL;DR:Ended a friendship with someone who constantly vented about their problems, didn't make efforts to change, and made me feel uncomfortable sharing my own issues. Despite their pleas to reconsider, I believe it was necessary for my mental well-being. AITB?
25	adjudicated	NTB	**Throwaway account - sorry if it's very messy story. TLDR; in end.**  Basically I (28F) have had an ex boyfriend (27M) of more than 6 years, the break-up happened more than 1,5 years ago, the emotions are gone on both sides. Since we have broken up, we remained friends, and occasionally hooked up, most of which was initiated by him.  This happened in the last few months too, until a week ago or so, he has confessed that he has a new girlfriend - so essentially he has cheated on her with me in the last 4-5 months, despite me stating it as a very clear boundary, that I wouldn't want to hookup with him if he isn't single. I immediately tried to convince him to tell his girlfriend that he has cheated, but he said he will continue lying, both for his own happiness, both for her safety, because he's concerned she would hurt herself.  The girl found out about us being in contact, but not the cheating itself, however she is understandably furious, and is demanding to see our online interactions, in which she would see me trying to convince my ex to be honest and admit to the cheating, while he's like yeah I will keep misleading her.  He's been begging me to delete messages that show him being flirty and me trying to convince him to be honest so he can continue misleading his girlfriend, however I have refused to do so.  He's claiming she would harm herself, and it made me think, **so Reddit, AITB for not agreeing to delete the messages?**  *TLDR; was hooking up with ex on the condition we are both single, turns out he had a gf he cheated on with me, now he's asking me to delete messages and lie so he can mislead his girlfriend and not admit he cheated - he claims it's for her own benefit because she's very unwell mentally.*
353	adjudicated	EAB	My (now ex) bf and I were at a store a couple months ago and were looking at a display of cute, decorative magnets they had.  I was pointing out which ones I liked and he said “These look like plastic. It’s hard to tell if they’re real or not, ya know?”. He said this in a bit of an angry tone, but to be fair he was already in a bad mood and didn’t want to go out that day.  I didn’t know what he meant by “real magnets” because they were all stuck on a metal board so clearly they were magnetic. I asked what he meant by that and he just repeated that he doesn’t know if they’re real.  I took this to be some type of sly insult because he had questioned my loyalty, honesty, and if I’m “real or fake” with him many, many times throughout the relationship.  I got upset with him in the store because he wouldn’t explain what he meant by the real magnet comment and acted like I was being crazy for reading into it. Which maybe I was?  I was going to buy him a couple things from the store but because of the fight I didn’t.  Was I wrong here? Are “real” vs “fake” magnets a thing?    EDIT:   For context, I’ve never assumed that anybody else was insulting me indirectly like this prior to dating him. I got the idea that this could be a way of insulting someone because he had previously accused me of doing that.   For example, I once said a drink he ordered was big (bc the portion was huge) and he thought that I only said the drink was big to make him feel like his dick was small. I didn’t mean it like that though. 
389	adjudicated	NTB	So, I (30m) was talking to an acquaintance (27F). Not a friend, not a partner, just someone I've talked to maybe 5 times. We got on the topic of where we lived. I live by myself in an apartment, and she lives with a male roommate who is not her partner, nor her friend. She actually tells me mostly about how he is weird (not too many details).  She tells me she has a sister (18F) who needs an apartment close to a nearby college and would split the rent. I explain a few things.  A). This is a 1BR apartment. B). I personally don't want to live with the opposite gender that I'm not in a relationship with.  The acquaintance said my traditional conservative views (false btw. I'm moderate leaning liberal) are misogynistic and oppressive to women. She said that as a man making more money, I have an obligation to help the less financially fortunate women overcome the system that's oppressing them.  I don't have anything against her living with a man platonically. Its her choice. However, I could not live with the opposite gender platonically, it is simply not what I personally feel comfortable with. I also feel like her whole financial thing is taking feminism wayyyy out of context and way too far.  But what do yall think?
